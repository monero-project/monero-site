### The Monero Core Team

Monero is not governed by any foundation or central body, but ongoing development, maintenance, and research is primarily directed and often funded by a core team of seven individuals.

Five members of the Core Team prefer to stay pseudonymous for the moment, but two of them are more public and have revealed their real identities. For ease of reference those two members (Riccardo and David) are at the top of the list below, but beyond that the list is presented in no particular order:

- **Riccardo "fluffypony" Spagni** (*ric@getmonero.org*)**:** Based out of South Africa, Riccardo brings a strong business acumen and a deep understanding of cryptocurrency, software development, and cryptography to the table. He has been involved with cryptocurrency-related projects since 2012.
- **David Latapie** (*david@getmonero.org*)**:** David Latapie is a French publisher, transhumanist, and crypto enthusiast who has worked on various cryptocurrencies. He focuses on the societal changes brought about by cryptos and the blockchain technology.

- **smooth** (*smooth@getmonero.org*)**:** A software developer, entrepreneur, and investor, smooth has been involved in several cryptocurrency projects since 2011, including development of the first multicurrency exchange (initially supporting Bitcoin and Namecoin). By virtue of his long-standing involvement in the cryptocurrency community, he is well known and trusted by many.
- **othe** (*othe@getmonero.org*)**:** Based in Germany, othe has been interested in cryptocurrency since early 2011. Currently he works as an independent consultant for various cryptocurrency-related businesses. He is known for his previous work as a core Vertcoin developer.
- **tacotime** (*tacotime@getmonero.org*)**:** A bioinformatics enthusiast and software developer from Toronto, tacotime has been involved in cryptocurrency since 2011. He is well known for his work on MC2, a hybrid PoS/PoW cryptocurrency, and his contributions to various Conformal projects such as btcd.
- **NoodleDoodle** (*noodledoodle@getmonero.org*)**:** A former Silicon Valley engineer, NoodleDoodle is a seasoned hardware and software developer. He started his involvement with cryptocurrencies in 2012 and currently spends his time working on "cool aerospace stuff" for a university.
- **eizh** (*eizh@getmonero.org*)**:** An American researcher and academic who focuses on physics and scientific computing by day, eizh holds an academic interest in cryptocurrencies, especially serious alternatives to Bitcoin.

### Development Contributors

There have been many individuals that have contributed to Monero code; a complete list of which can be found on our [Github Contributors page](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors).

Some that have made outstanding contributions include: [moneromooo](http://github.com/moneromooo-monero/bitmonero/branches), [Thomas Winget](https://github.com/tewinget), [mikezackles](https://github.com/mikezackles), [oranjuice](https://github.com/oranjuice), [warptangent](https://github.com/warptangent), [rfree](https://github.com/rfree2monero), [jakoblind](https://github.com/jakoblind), and [tomerkon](https://github.com/tomerkon).

### The Monero Research Lab

The Core Team forms an integral part of the Monero Research Lab, but the researchers, scientists, and academics that are primarily focused on Monero research are listed below. They have chosen to remain pseudonymous for the moment. They are:

- **Surae Noether:** Lead researcher for the Monero Research Lab, Surae holds a PhD in Mathematical Sciences and brings a rich understanding of cryptography and homological algebra to the mix.
- **Shen Noether:** A graduate student focused on algebraic geometry, it is Shen's command and knowledge of cryptography that lends itself so well to his involvement in the Monero Research Lab.
- **Simba Noether:** A Masters candidate pursuing research in cryptography and cryptocurrencies. Simba's previous work includes theoretical research in lattice cryptography and decentralized authentication.
- **Sarang Noether:** Having completed his Masters in Mathematical Sciences, Sarang is currently completing his doctoral degree in Physics, while devoting time on the side to the advancement of Monero research.

### Other Contributors

There have been massive contributions to Monero from its inception from so many people, including: zone117x, LucasJones, wolf`, Professor David Andersen, wallet42, Neozaru, Gingeropolous, cAPSLOCK, and many, many others.
