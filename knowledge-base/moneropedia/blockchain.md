### The Basics
"A @blockchain is a distributed database that continuously grows with a record of all of the transactions that have occurred with a given cryptocurrency.  This database is often referred to as a ledger because the data contains a large list of transctions that have taken place.  In Monero, these transactions are packaged together into 'blocks' every 2 minutes (on average) and all miners and nodes on the network have copies of these blocks.  

### Monero's @Blockchain
Some of the differences in Monero, as compared to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, is that transactions in the Monero @blockchain do not reveal who the funds came from or went to providing anonymity and making the currency completely fungible. Additionaly, the amounts of all transactions are hidden by @RingCT. For auditing or other purposes a user can share a @view-key to prove they control certain amounts of @Monero.
