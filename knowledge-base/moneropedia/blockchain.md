### The Basics

A distributed ledger of all transactions both past and present. This ledger is made up of a series of [blocks](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/block). In Monero, the blockchain does not reveal who the funds came from or went to. To see how the blockchain is obscured, see [ring signatures](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/ringsignatures).
