### The Basics
"A @blockchain is a distributed database that continuously grows with a record of all of the transactions that have occurred with a given cryptocurrency.  This database is often referred to as a ledger because the data contains a large list of transctions that have taken place.  In Monero, these transactions are packaged together into 'blocks' every 2 minutes (on average) and all miners and nodes on the network have copies of these blocks.  

### Monero's @Blockchain
"One of the unique features of Monero, as compared to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, is that transactions in the Monero @blockchain do not reveal who the funds came from or went to, nor the amounts of any transactions. (optionally a user can share a @view-key with others to show they control certain amounts of @Monero  .  

Each individual monero user controls who can see their transactions with a key called the '@view-key'.
