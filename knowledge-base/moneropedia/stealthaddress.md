### The Basics

Stealth addresses are an important part of Monero's inherent privacy. They allow and require the sender to create random one-time addresses for every @transaction on behalf of the recipient. The recipient can publish just one address, yet have all of his/her incoming payments go to unique addresses on the @blockchain, where they cannot be linked back to either the recipient's published address or any other transactions' addresses. By using stealth addresses, only the sender and receiver can determine where a payment was sent.

When you create a Monero wallet, you’ll get a private @view-key and a private spendkey. The spendkey is needed for making payments, the @view-key is used to “claim” incoming transactions. Both the public spendkey and @view-key are used to build your monero address. You can have a “watch only” wallet that only uses the @view-key. This feature can be used for accounting or auditing purposes but is currently unreliable due to the inability to track outgoing transactions. You can decide who can see your balance by handing out your @view-key. Monero is private by default and optionally semi-transparent!

When using the Monero GUI this is handled by the wallet software.  Sending Monero is as easy as entering the destination address and the amount and pressing send.  To recieve Monero, simply provide the sender your public address.
