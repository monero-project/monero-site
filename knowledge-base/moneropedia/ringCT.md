### The Basics
RingCT, short for Ring Confidential Transactions, is a way to hide the amount sent in a Monero transaction. 

Ring CT was implemented in block #1220516 and is currently used in over 95% of @Monero transactions.  After September 2017 this feature will be required for all transactions on the network.

RingCT introduces an improved version of @ring-signatures called A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature, which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation.
