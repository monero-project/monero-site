### The Basics
RingCT, short for ring confidential transactions, is a way to hide the amount sent in a Monero transaction. This feature is currently in the testnet phase and is a high development priority.
RingCT introduces an improved version of @ring signatures called A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature, which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation.
