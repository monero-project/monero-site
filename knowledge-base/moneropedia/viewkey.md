### The Basics

Monero features an opaque blockchain (with an explicit allowance system called the @view-key), in sharp contrast with transparent blockchain used by any other cryptocurrency not based on @CryptoNote. Thus, Monero is said to be "private, optionally transparent". 

Every Monero address has a private @view-key which can be shared.  By sharing a @view-key a person is allowing access to view every incoming transaction for that address.  However, outgoing transactions can not currently be reliably viewed. Therefore the balance of a Monero address as shown via a @view-key should not be relied upon.
