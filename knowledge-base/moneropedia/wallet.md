### The Basics

A wallet stores the information necessary to send and receive Monero.  In addition to sending and receiving, the Monero GUI wallet keeps a private history of your transactions and allows you to cryptographically sign messages.  It also includes mining software and an address book.

A hot wallet is one which is connected to the Internet.  You can send funds easily but security is lower than a cold wallet.  Never store large amounts of any cryptocurrency in a hot wallet.

A cold wallet is generated on a trusted device or computer via an @airgap.  If the device is to be reused, the data storage should be securely overwritten.  As soon as a cold wallet is connected to the internet, or its mnemonic phrase or @spend-key is entered on an internet-connected device, it's no longer "cold" and should be considered "hot".

A Monero cold wallet can be generated by downloading the source code of https://moneroaddress.org/.  Verify the signature of the code on a trusted airgapped device.  Create the wallet and print or store it on the media of your choice.

Monero wallets can be stored on any media - paper, USB drive, CD/DVD, or a hardware wallet device (none available as of June 2017).
