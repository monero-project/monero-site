To most people, financial privacy is very important, but banks, big corporations and

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.520
even governments are having their records&nbsp;
compromised. The undeniable conclusion is there's

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.640
no safe place to conduct private transactions. Well, there wasn't one, until now. Meet Monero.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.120
Monero is a secure, private, untraceable&nbsp;
currency. With Monero you are your own bank.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.560
Only you control and are responsible for your&nbsp;
funds. Monero is private, this means businesses

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.160
can keep their suppliers in secret, as well&nbsp;
as citizens escape government repressions

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
and nosy neighbors or crooks. Monero can also be selectively transparent and you can choose

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.920
who you want to see the transactions. Monero is dynamically scalable which makes it very different

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.880
from a bitcoin. Also, the block reward will never drop below 0.3 XMR and the nominal inflation will

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.440
stay at 0.3 XMR per minute. Monero is decentralized, it has an active development community with more

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.880
than 30 contributors. Take back control over&nbsp;
your finances and start using Monero today.
