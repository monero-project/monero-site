# Introduction

As a way to celebrate and show the growth that has happened for Monero across the past year on this, the 7th anniversary of the Monero project, I wanted to take a snapshot of statistics and social media posts to highlight this growth.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of ways in which Monero grew, and some of the most important growth came in increased acceptance and adoption of Monero for donations and payments:

- [Merchants accepting Monero for payment](https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/)
- [FOSS Projects and Pro-Privacy Organizations accepting Monero for donations](https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/foss-donations/)

# Statistics

One of the most important ways we can deduce what has been happening in Monero is to look at the (thankfully, sparse) blockchain data available publicly.

Each section will highlight the previous year (04/2019 through 04/2020) as well as the current year (04/2020 through 04/2021) to give year-over-year comparisons and perspective.

- Monero transactions grew from ~7,000tx per day to ~10,000tx per day

*** Disclaimer: These miner numbers are the lower bound, as they are the numbers visible via API of public pools where the API is reachable and provides miner count. There are likely many more miners that are solo, use private pools, or are on pools that do not expose miner count.***

# Major Upgrades

- [CLSAG, a new ring signature mechanism that improves transaction efficiency](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/clsag.html)
  - "CLSAG, users see a 20% improvement in signature verification, and at least a 10% overall improvement for typical transactions. For example, a typical Monero transaction (2 inputs and 2 outputs) which usually weighs 2.5kB, takes only 1.9kB of blockchain space with CLSAG, a ~25% improvement."
- [Monero put out several updates to resolve and prevent network attacks from a prolonged and aggressive attack on the p2p network](https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/moneros-ongoing-network-attack/)
  - "Monero‚Äôs peer-to-peer (p2p) network has been undergoing several different types of attack by an entity who has consistently attacked, spammed, and attempted to undermine the Monero network and community for years."

# Something Missing?

If you see something missing from this post that was a major highlight of the year, please feel free to reach out via [Twitter, Matrix, or email](https://sethforprivacy.com/about/#how-to-contact-me) and I'll work to get it added ASAP.

# Resources Used

Here is a quick list of the sources and tools I used to gather these statistics:

- `monero-blockchain-stats`, using some hints from the following link for plotting:
  - <https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/4694>
- [Gnuplot](https://www.gnuplot.info/) for the graphs from data pulled via `monero-blockchain-stats`
- <https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero> for hashrate graph and current miner count
- <https://subredditstats.com/r/monero> for subreddit-related statistics and graphs
- <https://github.com/oduwsdl/FollowerCountHistory> for Twitter follower count history for @monero
