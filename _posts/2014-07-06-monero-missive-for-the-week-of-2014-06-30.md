Hello, and welcome to our fifth Monero Missive!

**Major Updates**

1. fluffypony had a great time discussing Monero at the Bitcoin Supernode Conference in Estonia. Many thanks to rpietila for hosting him and all attendees.

2. Work on the academic peer review of the CryptoNote whitepaper is slowly starting to move away from an academic platform and on to the code itself, to determine whether the reference implementation correctly implements the whitepaper. Before that happens, though, a summary of the initial findings will be published. We are expecting this to be completed this coming week.

3. Transaction auto-splitting is now in the main codebase. To explain our methodology: the main github repo will always be "active development", and may contain code that will be reverted or is not fully tested. For those that are brave and want to test and contribute to development, it is the ideal starting point. However, on an ongoing basis we are going to create tagged releases, whereby when a group of new features have been fully tested, a new release can be tagged, and binaries can be put out (along with the code on the github tag, of course). Expect this change to start taking effect within the next 4 weeks.

4. We'd like to apologise for not finalise the GUI bounty - everyone has been a little scattered this week. We will resolve this in its entirety within the next 48 hours!

This Missive is a little light on major updates (well, we can't have something major every week;) primarily because there has been lots of plotting and planning this week. As always: you can keep up to date with the nitty-gritty on IRC in #monero-dev on Freenode if you're interested.

Until next week!
