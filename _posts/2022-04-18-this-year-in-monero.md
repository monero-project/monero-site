As a way to celebrate and show the growth that has happened for Monero across the past year on this, the 8th anniversary of the Monero project, I wanted to take a snapshot of statistics and social media posts to highlight this growth.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of ways in which Monero grew, and some of the most important growth came in increased acceptance and adoption of Monero for donations and payments:

- [Merchants accepting Monero for payment](https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/)
- [FOSS Projects and Pro-Privacy Organizations accepting Monero for donations](https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/foss-donations/)
- [Coincards Monero Volume](https://twitter.com/CoinCards/status/1508324025256202246?cxt=HHwWjMCqubSt0u4pAAAA)

# Statistics

One of the most important ways we can deduce what has been happening in Monero is to look at the (thankfully, sparse) blockchain data available publicly.

Each section will highlight the previous year (04/2020 through 04/2021) as well as the current year (04/2021 through 04/2022) to give year-over-year comparisons and perspective.
