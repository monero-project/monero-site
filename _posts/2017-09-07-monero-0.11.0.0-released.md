### Overview

This is the v0.11.0.0 major release of the Monero software, and it is a mandatory update due to the September 15th hard fork, which in turn increases the minimum ring signature size across the network and bans duplicate ring members in a ring signature. This release of the software presents a number of major improvements to Monero, as well as a large set of bug fixes.

Some highlights of this release are:

- major synchronisation speed-up
- massively improved the blockchain import function
- changed terminology from "mixin" to "ring size"
- add a --fluffy-blocks option to relay blocks as fluffy blocks if possible
- allow for password verification without loading the subsequently unencrypted wallet into RAM
- reduced privacy leak risks when using untrusted remote nodes
- added an Esperanto wordlist
- decreased memory demands for the getblocks RPC call
- added a "fee" command to display fee information
- add average seconds per block in bc\_dyn\_stats
- added an on\_get\_alt\_blocks\_hashes RPC call 
- enabled support for ppc64le architectures
- added an Italian translation for the CLI
- return the per-tx amount in the transfer\_split RPC call
- switched to readline for the CLI
- added a histogram to poolstats
- enable support for macOS smart mining
- added the ability to build a Snap package
- added a Vulnerability Response Process, with bug bounties available via [a dedicated HackerOne portal](https://hackerone.com/monero)
- added support for payment proving via key derivation instead of tx key reveal
- changed output selection for ring signatures to heavily weight newer outputs
- added a sweep\_below function to sweep small amounts
- moved the mempool to a database on disk instead of keeping it all in memory
- fully enable iOS and Android full node support
- added the ability to create wallets via RPC
- added ability to relay transactions manually after creating them
- transfer CLI command warns if there's a tx backlog for selected fee
- better AC / battery power detection for Linux smart mining
- getblocktemplate now indicates the expected total reward
- as always, loads of bug fixes and performance improvements
