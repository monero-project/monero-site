Hello, and welcome to our twenty-first Monero Monday Missive!

**Major Updates**

1. We're aware of the 0.8.8.6 slow startup issues on some Windows environments (over an hour for the daemon to startup for some people). We believe we've identified the problem, and will be rolling out a test fix in the next couple of days, for inclusion in 0.8.8.7

2. There have been a number of patches merged over the past week to fix issues with simplewallet's new multi-language mnemonics

Until next week!
