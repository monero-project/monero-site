### Overview

This is the **v0.15.0 release of the Monero software**. This major release, announced in an [earlier post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/10/01/announcement-release-0-15.html), is due to the November 30th network upgrade. Users, merchants and exchanges should update to the latest Monero software before that date. The binaries for the GUI wallet are forthcoming, we will make another announcement as soon as they are released.

Some of the major changes introduced with this release are:

- **New PoW (RandomX)** based on random instructions, adapted to CPUs
- **Android builds**
- **Automatic public nodes discovery** and bootstrap daemon switching
- **Improved network protections** for connections between wallets and nodes
- **Pay for service system** (either for nodes to offer paid RPC, or third parties to offer services paid for via monero mining)
- **Optional Tor/I2P** transaction relay for privacy (block relay being done on clearnet)
- **New gen_ssl_cert tool** to generate SSL certificates suitable for Monero usage
- **IPv6** support
- **Removed Long Payment IDs** (see the [deprecation announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/06/04/Long-Payment-ID-Deprecation.html))

**Important note:** This release contains a bug which makes problematic (very slow) to sync the blockchain from scratch. A fix was already introduced and will be available with a subsequent point release, which will be out very soon.
