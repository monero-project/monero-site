The repository of the Getmonero.org website was migrated from Gitlab (https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site) to GitHub (https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site). All issues and pull requests should now be opened on GitHub.

In 2018 we decided to migrate the repositories containing this website and the [CCS platform](https://ccs.getmonero.org) from GitHub to Gitlab, in response to Microsoft buying the former. After a long period of testing we now decided to move back the monero-site repository to GitHub. The CCS related repositories are staying on Gitlab (CCS Frontend, CCS Backend, CCS Proposals) and the monero-site repository on Gitlab will be used as a mirror. To understand the reasoning behind these changes, read the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/236).

Nothing about the Community Crowdfunding System has changed. If you want to open a CCS proposal, please keep using Gitlab as before.
