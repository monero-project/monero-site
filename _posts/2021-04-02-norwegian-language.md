We are happy to announce that after months of work, this website is now available in Norwegian!

Norwegian is the 14th language available for getmonero.org, following English, Spanish, Italian, Polish, French, Arabic, Russian, German, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, Turkish, Chinese simplified and Chinese traditional.

A big thanks to ChrisAvis and the [community crowdfunding](https://ccs.getmonero.org/) that made his work possible. Translators like him allow Monero to continue to reach a much larger audience.

To browse the website in Norwegian, simply select `Norsk` from the language dropdown menu on the top right, or use this direct link: [https://www.getmonero.org/nb-no/index.html](https://www.getmonero.org/nb-no/index.html)
