### Overview

This is the v0.12.0.0 point release of the Monero software, and it is part of the v0.12 network wide update. This major release is due to the April 6th network update, which in turn increases the minimum ring signature size, sorts inputs so as not to leak wallet choice by inference, and slightly changes the proof-of-work algorithm to prevent DoS attacks by ASICs. This release of the software presents a number of major improvements to Monero, as well as a large set of bug fixes.

Some highlights of this major release are:

- tweaked PoW to block DoS attacks from ASICs
- added input ordering to prevent wallet inference
- increased minimum ring size from 5 to 7
- subaddress support added, with addresses starting with a prefix of 8
- added multisig support
- added support for SunOS / Solaris
- initial support for Ledger Nano S hardware wallet
- added seed encryption by password
- securely erase keys from memory, for most cases, when no longer in use
- initial Bulletproofs implementation live on testnet
- added accounts, tags, and labels, via subaddresses
- added initial, quite rough support for 0MQ
- added some mitigations for privacy-threatening key reusing forks
- added a new network, stagenet, which mirrors mainnet's features
- added SSL support for light wallet API

- enabled "fluffy blocks" by default
- added a --max-txpool-size mempool size limit flag
- allow a remote node to temporarily process RPC requests during IBD

- made libraries use position independent code
- improvements made to Docker image
- added a sweep_single command to the CLI wallet
- made RPC error codes more specific
- improved stack trace printing, and noted stack trace lib in output
- split and refactored wallet_api from wallet code
- added priority arguments to sweep_all and donate CLI wallet commands
- added a --do-not-relay option to the CLI wallet
- made the hashchain unit tests work again
- added tests for subaddress expansion
- added RingCT performance tests
- added package installation instructions for Void Linux
- made changes to ensure no sensitive data is logged accidentally
- added a Croatian mnemonic word list
- added a Lojban mnemonic word list
- added a Swedish CLI translation
