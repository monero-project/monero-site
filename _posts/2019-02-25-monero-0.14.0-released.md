### Overview

This is the v0.14.0 release of the Monero software. This major release is due to the March 9th network update, which in turn adds a new PoW based on Cryptonight-R, adds a new block weight algorithm, and introduces a slightly more efficient RingCT format. This is a intermediary, stable release specifically for the network update, and does not represent the bulk of the effort on Monero over the past 6 months. That effort will be in the 0.14.1 release, which will follow in March after the network update.

Some highlights of this major release are:

- New PoW based on Cryptonight-R
- New block weight algorithm
- New slightly more efficient RingCT format
- Placeholder short payment ID to increase transaction uniformity
- Obsolete long payment IDs are now disabled unless a switch is used
- New event notifications for large block rate changes and blockchain reorgs
- Unmixable outputs can be spent again
- Fix bad pruned transactions JSON in RPC
- Some build fixes for various platforms/setups
- Fix for crash on exit
