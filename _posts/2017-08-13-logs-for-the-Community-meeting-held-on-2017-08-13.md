# Logs  

**\<sgp>** Meeting is starting  
**\<sgp>** 0. Introduction  
**\<sgp>** We would like to welcome everyone to this Monero Community Meeting  
**\<cryptochangement>** hello all  
**\<sgp>** Link to agenda on GitHub: https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/105  
**\<sgp>** Monero Community meetings intend to be a discussion place for anything going on in the Monero Community. We plan to use this meeting and future meetings to encourage the community to share ideas and provide support.  
**\<sgp>** 1. Greetings  
**\<serhack>** hello  
**\<rehrar>** Yo yo  
**\<moneromax>** howdy doody  
**\<Jgiejheufhd>** Hello  
**\<sgp>** Looks like we have a small crowd today  
**\<sgp>** 2. Justin’s report and community resources  
**\<sgp>** I’m consuming valuable meeting time again this week! I want to mention that I have posted my third and final FFS proposal for the summer. Along with the proposal are paragraphs of learning opportunities I had while abroad, and several presentations for you to choose from when you all speak to your local communities :p  
**\<sgp>** You can view the FFS proposal here: https://forum.getmonero.org/6/ideas/88081/justin-s-local-meetup-talks-proposal-3  
**\<rupee>** hello  
**\<4matter>** hello  
**\<sgp>** You can view the presentations here: https://github.com/SamsungGalaxyPlayer/monero-presentations  
**\<serhack>** nice sgp!  
**\<sgp>** Unless there are any other comments, we can move on to #3  
**\<serhack>** no comments? :0  
**\<cryptochangement>** looks all good thats a lot of places!  
**\<sgp>** Yeah! 21 talks in 20 cities  
**\<rehrar>** Comment = good  
**\<sgp>** 3. Serhack’s web-integration updates  
**\<sgp>** Serhack, being the amazing community member that he is, has some updates regarding his web-integration plugins. He asked to reserve some time during this meeting to discuss these, and I yield the floor to him to speak a bit about these.  
**\<serhack>** okay, let's start  
**\<serhack>** Hello everyone  
**\<serhack>** First of all, thanks for supporting me. This community is so strong and that helped me a lot during development.  I have a lot of excited  news.  
**\<serhack>** About development  
**\<serhack>** - Implemented a verifying payment script - Implemented the 70% of Woocommerce extension (missing: translations, some improvements on User Interface and User Experience) - Implemented the 40% of Prestashop plugin (missing: translations, User interface, solid backend) Until september I will complete the 90% two plugins (probably missing: translations by community)  
**\<serhack>** Business part: - I've tried to contact Automattic, company of Woocommerce, and I've asked them if they were able to put our integrations under "Trusted extension" list. They answered me after two days: "Hello [..], currently our market is closed [..]". No way, I think they have special contracts with company like paypal and strype :( - I'm trying to submit the Woocommerce Payment Gateway to Wordpress.org list , I have to improve my librar  
because I discovered that cURL is very very slow with wordpress. - I will try to sell the integrations on markets like Codecanyon by Envato. Please pay attention: I won't sell "plugins", but I will sell "Business support" in order to support other sub-projects by community (like Monero mobile wallet) - There is an option that will increase payments by Monero: every user that will pay by XMR will receive a discount on e-shop of merchant. Merchant ca  
select if he/she wants to incentivate monero as payment.  
**\<serhack>** this is the huge text that I wrote yesterday  
**\<serhack>** what do you think? I can show you some screenshots  
**\<sgp>** Sounds like the merchant resources are coming along nicely  
**\<rehrar>** Share via imgur  
**\<serhack>** http://imgur.com/a/BonJi  
**\<serhack>** http://imgur.com/a/KjNUj  
**\<4matter>** and post on reddit too  
**\<serhack>** 4matter: of course, I will  
**\<sgp>** Yeah, people on Reddit will love the progress. Especially with screenshots  
**\<4matter>** cool  
**\<serhack>** I'm "opening" a demo e-shop  
**\<cryptochangement>** i think that it is important to note that although the wordpress plugin is not finished, you can download a "release" from https://github.com/monero-integrations/monerowp/releases and it is completely usable for anyone that wants to use it early  
**\<serhack>** cryptochangement: thanks!  
**\<serhack>** infact, woocommerce plugin is stable but with errors  
**\<sgp>** @serhack anything else you want to discuss?  
**\<serhack>** http://imgur.com/a/ZoNDF  
**\<serhack>** nothing, thanks for this space!  
**\<cryptochangement>** hold on  
**\<cryptochangement>** i had one idea  
**\<serhack>** about my web integration?  
**\<cryptochangement>** serhack i would like your opinion on this (and other community members too) since the wordpress plugin is pretty stable and (in my opinion) works well, i think it would be good to include it on getmonero.org on the "merchants" page  
**\<serhack>** cryptochangement: it's a nice idea!  
**\<serhack>** anyway I'm developing a little page for merchant  
**\<serhack>** that will explain why monero should be use for business  
**\<cryptochangement>** great!  
**\<sgp>** 4. What to name the Q3 release (#2265)  
**\<sgp>** The time is almost up to decide the name for the release for the upcoming fork next month! https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/2265  
**\<serhack>** nice point sgp  
**\<sgp>** Please comment on GitHub with your ideas. It seems like “Helium Hydra” has reached rough consensus, so make the to say whether you agree or disagree before it’s too late!  
**\<serhack>** I think it's important  
**\<sgp>** \*so make sure to say  
**\<cryptochangement>** I vote for Helium Hydra, and i think that 90% of github agrees haha  
**\<4matter>** nice name  
**\<sgp>** Agreed :)  
**\<sgp>** Anyway, if you have a better one, head to GitHub and let people know  
**\<sgp>** 5. Community highlights  
**\<sgp>** In this new segment, I would like to thank the efforts by Monero community members that have gone above and beyond. While this can include development, I want to make sure to cover some of the other things happening in the community that may have gone under the radar.  
**\<sgp>** Over the past month, I have noticed a significant increase in the number of posts showing Monero in a positive light in /r/CryptoCurrency. Examples include the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6oir0o , https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6rcr1d , https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6svt4u , https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6rnlag  
**\<sgp>** I would like to especially thank /u/xmronadaily, /u/afighttilldeath, /u/denk0815, and /u/lethos3 for stirring up the conversation there. Of course, countless other Monero community members hang out in /r/CryptoCurrency and have contributed in all of the linked comment threads, but these users specifically have gone above and beyond to build the Monero community.  
**\<sgp>** Of course, dEBRUYNE overachieved by adding labels to everything on GitHub.  
**\<sgp>** Thanks to /u/Riiume for starting the first weekly Monero “Tracking” Challenge! To those who are up for a (hopefully impossible) challenge, make sure to check it out! There is a sizable monetary reward associated with it: http://www.monerotrackingchallenge.com/  
**\<dEBRUYNE>** I haven't gone through all of them yet :)  
**\<sgp>** There are only 1 or 2 days left!  
**\<sgp>** Ok, @dEBRUYNE, quite a few things  
**\<dEBRUYNE>** For monero-core we have the following labels btw: bug, feature, enhancement, high prio, easy, help wanted, resolved, duplicate, wontfix   
**\<JollyMort[m]>** tracking challenge is good marketing considering it's impossible to determine the address :D  
**\<dEBRUYNE>** If anyone has recommendations on which one to add to a particular issue, please PM me  
**\<sgp>** @jollymort fingers crossed  
**\<sgp>** /u/digitaltreegames has posted several accurate articles about Monero on their website and has maintained strong and positive communication with the Monero community. See the two articles about Monero here: http://thecryptotrading.com/quick-beginners-guide-to-monero-xmr/ , http://thecryptotrading.com/monero-news-august-2017/  
**\<sgp>** /u/zhizhongzhiwai has been working hard without donations to build the Monero Chinese community from scratch. He has updated the community through every part of the process. Monero needs local experts in different parts of the world to step up and build these communities.  
**\<moneromooo>** I'm not sure whether that's known or not, but... There's a neverending stream of snake oil in cryptography. Companies peddling shit "patented", "military grade" cryptosystems that are plain crap. A common gimmick is to issue a competition to break those, and, invariably, nobody bothers spending the time to do so.  
**\<4matter>** it would be great if he hosted a monero meetup in china too  
**\<4matter>** i PM'd him on reddit...but no response...so if anyone talks to him, mention it  
**\<sgp>** @4matter I will see if he is able to translate my or Riccardo's presentations and record them  
**\<4matter>** makes sense!  
**\<sgp>** Obviously there are thousands of other community participants not included here. Does anyone else want to speak highly of another contributor?  
**\<4matter>** you!  
**\<sgp>** nah other people :p  
**\<rehrar>** *chants* S-G-P. S-G-P  
**\<cryptochangement>** ^ +1  
**\<4matter>** rehrar for helping with the esports sponsorship...we'll discuss that later  
**\<4matter>** :P  
**\<sgp>** @4matter yes :)  
**\<sgp>** Thanks everyone  
**\<sgp>** 6. Proof of Work discussion  
**\<sgp>** I do not want to take much public comment here, but there is a very important issue on GitHub. The discussion will determine what to do with Monero’s Proof of Work. Monero uses the CryptoNight PoW algorithm, and some people have suggested switching to a different algorithm as soon as possible while potential conflicts are smaller. Please join this discussion if you are interested: https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/12  
**\<serhack>** S-G-P  
**\<ArticMine>** I second that  
**\<sgp>** This comment in particular gives the high-level options available https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/12#issuecomment-320586397  
**\<sgp>** Super serious stuff here, so please review the info, even if you only understand some parts of it  
**\<sgp>** 7. Overwatch sponsorship discussion  
**\<sgp>** @4matter has contacted someone who is interested in possibly being sponsored by Monero. @4matter, the floor is yours to discuss this development :)  
**\<sgp>** \*by the Monero community  
**\<4matter>** great...thanks...rehrar is here too  
**\<sgp>** Not from the core team :)  
**\<rehrar>** Oh, I think I'm supposed to soak here. :P  
**\<rehrar>** Speak\*  
**\<4matter>** yes  
**\<rehrar>** Unless 4matter wants to ofc  
**\<4matter>** :P  
**\<rehrar>** Ok coo  
**\<4matter>** go ahead man!  
**\<rehrar>** So yeah, 4matter has taken an amazing initiative and contacted a local Overwatch team (which is a competetive video game for those who don't know)  
**\<serhack>** oh nice 4matter  
**\<rehrar>** The manager is interested in hearing what we would have to offer them.  
**\<rehrar>** The way sponsorships typically work is a sponsor gives money or equipment to help pay for expenses for the team  
**\<sn0wmonster>** as a bitcoiner for 9 years, dogecoiner for 4, a monero user for 1 week, i have some advice  
**\<rehrar>** And in return, they put symbols when the players stream, or maybe a the sponsor on the jerseys and stuff.  
**\<rehrar>** These things can be discussed.  
**\<rehrar>** Sure sn0wmonster  
**\<sn0wmonster>** stop giving money away for cheap promotions when the reason monero is going to outperform Bitcoin is because it is more professional  
**\<sn0wmonster>** focus on the strongpoints and market those in the *proper* channels  
**\<rehrar>** This is indeed a valid opinion.  
**\<sn0wmonster>** i highly recommend not clowning around with casuals in casual environments. whatever they need to know, they already know because of bitcoin,  
**\<rehrar>** One if the things that can be discussed here. :)  
**\<sgp>** @sn0wmonster what channels do you feel are proper?  
**\<sn0wmonster>** and any hateful ignorant opinions they have, they will think worse of Monero (because terrorism!)  
**\<sn0wmonster>** sgp, frankly, it's already being used in the proper communities  
**\<sn0wmonster>** it just needs to grow organically  
**\<4matter>** thoughtful input, sn0wmonster  
**\<serhack>** I can confirm that there is a sort of terrorism about Monero  
**\<4matter>** ok back on topic...  
**\<rehrar>** Does anybody have any other initial thoughts about the initiative?  
**\<rehrar>** Before I continue?  
**\<joro>** who is our target audience with this sponsorship?  
**\<moneromax>** and how do we propose to measure ROI?  
**\<4matter>** 30 million people play Overwatch  
**\<4matter>** approx.  
**\<cryptochangement>** I personally think that the pro-gaming community has a lot of people that would be interested in BTC/Monero so if we are going to do a sponsorship, this would actually be a pretty good audience  
**\<sn0wmonster>** for 9 years i've wqatched bitcoiners embarrass themselves with sponsorships, advertisements, and in the end, NEWS was the only real seller.  
**\<sn0wmonster>** If you want to promote Monero, start thinking like stock traders  
**\<sn0wmonster>** contact the news outlets and give them interviews  
**\<sn0wmonster>** tell them stories, give them exclusives  
**\<ffnopeg>** how big/small is Overwatch compared to Dota or LoL? I guess those other cannot be sponsored by monero  
**\<cryptochangement>** 4matter yeah i dont personally play overwatch but i know a shit load of people that do, its MASSIVELY popular  
**\<4matter>** sn0wmonsters...several insitutional investors own esports/overwatch teams  
**\<4matter>** thx :P  
**\<serhack>** sn0wmonster: interesting  
**\<sn0wmonster>** 4matter, you think an institutional investor is going to take their investment advice from a sports car?  
**\<sgp>** @sn0monster, thank you for your opinion. I am not dismissing it, but let's talk about the possible logistics here now and make a decision later  
**\<sn0wmonster>** they're going to read the journals  
**\<sn0wmonster>** okay, no worries  
**\<pigeons>** when i see some coin has sponsered something, i think why are they trying to pump it, and usually that is the only thing they are doing  
**\<4matter>** sn0wmonster...the community also done a lot to contact news outlets too...  
**\<4matter>** we got that covered!  
**\<sn0wmonster>** ive stabbed my eyes out for 9 years, just don't want the one cryptocurrency i actually *respect* to fall into the same trap is all :3  
**\<cryptochangement>** ffnopeg overwatch is much bigger than dota  
**\<pigeons>** yeah its really nice that monero is concentrated on working and not on promoting  
**\<sgp>** Do we have an estimate for how much they would expect? What are their demographics? Is the team well-known and/or competitive?  
**\<rehrar>** *shrug* pigeons, if some people are willing to give money to something like this, then what's the harm?  
**\<sgp>** the demographics of the spectators, I mean  
**\<rehrar>** If they aren't, then that's ok too.  
**\<cryptochangement>** I personally hate the idea of "marketing" monero, but i think that the type of person that follows an MLG team would actually be interested in monero for more than just trading/exchanges which IMO is what monero really needs  
**\<4matter>** my sense is that overwatch league is about to have it's first season, so the teams don't have any sponsorship structures in place. i think they are pretty open to whatever would be useful for the players/gamers on their team...  
**\<DaveyJones>** if you dont get some of those real PRO teams don`t bother with a sponsorship .... monero's "no advertising" brand is pretty strong to waste it on some tiny local team IMO  
**\<moneromax>** I think the main danger may be "promotion fatigue", where people get tired of throwing money at stuff with no measurable ROI.  
**\<4matter>** how would you measure ROI then moneromax  
**\<DaveyJones>** also sn0wmonster is right ... you can be sure 99,9 % of all real PRO players are already covered  
**\<rehrar>** Good discussion btw. :) Although it goes back to the tired conversation of whether Monero should market or not.  
**\<4matter>** DJ, 30 million eyeballs is not small  
**\<moneromooo>** 60  
**\<moneromax>** I don't claim to be an ROI-measuring genius, but there are specialists in that.  
**\<Link>** So does anyone know what sponsoring a team would actually cost? Ballpark?  
**\<rehrar>** Can I take the floor again?  
**\<rehrar>** Thanks  
**\<4matter>** sorry  
**\<sn0wmonster>** Monero is not a product, you don't market it like one  
**\<DaveyJones>** sure but sponsoring the nascar car that only drives in the back ... its not worth it besides the jerking off ... see dogecoin  
**\<4matter>** ok give rehrar the floor  
**\<rehrar>** Here's the thing. I think the community should decide. It doesn't hurt to bring the proposal to the community and see the response. This is only a small subset of the community.  
**\<pigeons>** yeah it really gives off a shady vibe  
**\<moneromax>** actually it is a product, something that is produced.  
**\<rehrar>** In regards to logistics, this would be something I'm not sure the FFS is good to handle, but there are few other options.  
**\<sn0wmonster>** moneromax, when's the last time you saw USD being advertised on a car? lol  
**\<4matter>** STFU snow  
**\<cryptochangement>** moneromax has a point. We really need to know about this team to figure out if it will be worth it. look at 8BTC it seems like a lot of people threw money at it not really knowing that mcuh about it and now we have a lot of work to do to get it to the point were the forum is actually used  
**\<4matter>** you've been here a week...sit back and be respectful lol  
**\<sgp>** @rehrar I suggest you and/or @4matter should suggest it with many of the burning questions (cost, target demographic, measurement of success/failure, pros/cons) answered so that we have some baseline  
**\<moneromax>** well products and promotions are separate considerations.  
**\<DaveyJones>** and if we a proceding the eSports angle ... i would rather prefer a tournament ... 50 % prize for the team 50 % prize for some charity of their choice... but i guess thats TOO big for the moment  
**\<sgp>** @4matter let's cool down, we all just want what's best  
**\<DaveyJones>** ^ this gives attention  
**\<rehrar>** Ooooh DaveyJones that's a cool idea.  
**\<4matter>** how are you sure sgp?  
**\<pigeons>** maybe someone wants to start an esports league that takes or pays monero, thats cool for someone to do, but "the monero community" sponsoring something, yuk  
**\<rehrar>** The Monero Community is not a brand that has certain standards. It's a lot of people that all have different opinions.  
**\<4matter>** ok so the owner of this Overwatch team we are considering ALSO is invested in http://corp.skillz.com  
**\<sgp>** I suppose I'm hopeful. Do you have an idea what you should do before we bring this up again? When is the deadline?  
**\<ArticMine>** We need to stay away from any formal sponsorships that are "official"  
**\<4matter>** maybe we could look into that?  
**\<ArticMine>** Money by is very nature needs to be neutral  
**\<cryptochangement>** rehrar the onyl problem i see with the "lets just give it a go" idea is that it seems like a lot of people feel obligated to support FFSs because they cant help on github. its good to see support byut we dont want people blindely throwing their money at this  
**\<4matter>** why articmine? lol  
**\<Link>** I think promoting Monero to communities that are most likely to benefit Monero would be the smartest approach. e.g. techies, libertarians, privacy advocates, etc.  
**\<rehrar>** That's another thing. This probably will not be handled by FFS.  
**\<rehrar>** I mean, it could for sure.  
**\<Link>** Promoting through e-sports might be useful, but probably not the best return for the money invested  
**\<ArticMine>** ... because I may want to use Monero on the competitive network  
**\<rehrar>** But this isn't typically what FFS is used for.  
**\<4matter>** so the 8btc had a great ROI?  
**\<4matter>** LMAO  
**\<rehrar>** Another option is to have a trusted community member manage the donated funds and help the team as best as he/she can with them.  
**\<ArticMine>** We cannot be seen as giving any formal endorsement of a product or service  
**\<rehrar>** Ok, this is getting a bit off.  
**\<sgp>** @4matter we will need to figure that out, but it could have used more coordination  
**\<4matter>** 8btc was a disaster  
**\<sgp>** Let's begin wrapping this up  
**\<moneromax>** I think the whole concept of the FFS could use some serious reworking.  
**\<Link>** I wouldn't say 8BTC is a disaster  
**\<joro>** how about a funding proposal for a real PR agency to arrange interviews with national outlets? radio/TV shows, etc? real coverage  
**\<4matter>** and yet shit like funding rehrar gets tossed to the side?  
**\<4matter>** pretty fucked up  
**\<rehrar>** Ok. Hold up. There needs to be something that needs to be established.  
**\<cryptochangement>** moneromax +1  
**\<pigeons>** no how about quit with the pr  
**\<Link>** The Chinese will come at some point, the 8BTC forum will be there with Chinese lanugage resources  
**\<rehrar>** Meh. I give up. I'll make a post about it later.  
**\<4matter>** Link, 8btc was/is a disaster  
**\<4matter>** sorry  
**\<4matter>** what's the ROI on that?  
**\<Link>** I mean, the cost was pretty steep  
**\<4matter>** Link, what is the ROI?  
**\<cryptochangement>** welp rehrar done given up...  
**\<rehrar>** :D  
**\<sgp>** I am going to move on. It looks like for the Overwatch proposal, we need to have more resources before we discuss it further  
**\<Link>** Impossible to evaluate  
**\<serhack>** how many xmr did community give for 8btc?  
**\<rehrar>** Just with this conversation with you guys for now.  
**\<sgp>** Thanks everyone for your opinions  
**\<rehrar>** Too many speakers.  
**\<cryptochangement>** serhack a shit load  
**\<ffnopeg>** at least I know that Overwatch is game, good "meeting"  
**\<Link>** Also, it was funded for a full year, so evaluate at the end of the year  
**\<sgp>** Let's not talk about 8btc at the moment :)  
**\<4matter>** this is really sad, guys  
**\<serhack>** okay sgp  
**\<DaveyJones>** link i even doubt that it will be taken off by then  
**\<rehrar>** 4matter, you and I will discuss privately soon. :)  
**\<sgp>** I am going to close all discussion about 8btc, Overwatch, an the FFS until the meeting is over to stay on topic  
**\<cryptochangement>** moooving on...  
**\<sgp>** 8. Open ideas time (but not 8btc, Overwatch, and FFS)  
**\<sgp>** It’s open ideas time! Feel free to propose your ideas to this discussion group, and feel free to comment on others’ ideas. If you disagree with the idea, please reply with constructive criticism. Thank you!  
**\<sn0wmonster>** **\<rehrar>** The Monero Community is not a brand that has certain standards. It's a lot of people that all have different opinions.  
**\<sgp>** Any other ideas from how to better the community?  
**\<moneromax>** I was going to just PM a few folks about this, but...  
**\<sn0wmonster>** and yet its using the official #monero registered project namespace for a meeting?  
**\<sn0wmonster>** why not ##monero-fanclub :P  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** on the FFS subject, it kind of bugs me how on redderp it's so common to see "let's do a FFS for X or for Y"  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** as if nothing happens unless someone funds it  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** offering money for anything can only bring in some actors to sucker the money away from the communitiy  
**\<sgp>** @keledoro followed up with me about his idea to contact some people, and we are working together on this. I will respond to him tomorrow  
**\<moneromax>** there was a recent topic by /u/ViolentlyPeaceful regarding a Monero Marketing hub.  
**\<serhack>** +1  
**\<sn0wmonster>** my opinion is that bitcoin succeeded because the banks understand it. Monero needs exposure, not advertising. there's a difference.  
**\<serhack>** We should have a Monero marketing hub  
**\<cryptochangement>** JollyMort[m] most people on reddit aren't developers so a lot of them see it as their only option to contribute, even if that isnt necissarily true  
**\<pero>** can anyone pastebin the log for me please?  
**\<sn0wmonster>** get exchanges to start using it (there are several already), make youtube videos explaining the difference between bitcoin and monero, focusing on the defacto-privacy model  
**\<pigeons>** make things that people will use  
**\<moneromax>** I've set up a Discourse instance on monero.marketing.  I thought I'd start out keeping it by invitation only.  
**\<pigeons>** and promote those things  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** sure, but if you give the impression you want to throw money...  
**\<pigeons>** not monero  
**\<sgp>** Imo, we need to be cautious of marketing, but I don't think all marketing is bad. At the end of the day, none of you can stop me from advertising Monero on TV :p  
**\<sn0wmonster>** use keywords that attract anarchocapitalists, preppers, anti-gov, libertarians, etc  
**\<moneromax>** I think Discourse is much nicer forum software than Reddit or forum.getmonero.org.  
**\<cryptochangement>** anybody got a "Don't buy monero" sign for sgp??  
**\<sn0wmonster>** pretty simple playbook already well established by bitcoiners ages ago. if anyone wants to have these discussions again, try reading the bitcointalk.org forums from year 3+  
**\<pero>** why not socialists and marxists?  
**\<pigeons>** yeah big tent  
**\<johnalan>** why not capitalists?  
**\<serhack>** everyone should use cryptocurrency  
**\<moneromax>** Anyway, if anyone is interested I guess PM /u/duzies for now.  
**\<sn0wmonster>** marxists don't believe in money, they use Marx brothers VHS for currency  
**\<Link>** Idea: Reddit ads on very targeted communities, such as r/libertarian, r/anarchist, r/privacy, etc.  
**\<pero>** thats not true  
**\<serhack>** if we use words like anti-gov, people will think we are anti-gov too  
**\<rupee>** One of the things that makes it difficult to trade goods/services for XMR is the trouble coming up with a fair exchange rate. It would be nice if there were an index similar to tradeblock.com/markets/index/ for monero that takes XMR/BTC price from the 3 main exchanges and multiplies by BTC/USD and volume-weights it  
**\<sn0wmonster>** pero, it was a poor joke  
**\<sgp>** Important marketing successes early on will boost the community's morale. They need to be planned well and executed well, which is hard in an open-source project  
**\<sn0wmonster>** serhack: and if we use words like "esports", people will think monero is a game coin  
**\<moneromax>** Marketing is misunderstood.  People confuse it with scammy promotion / snake oil.  
**\<pero>** can anyone pastebin the log for me please?  
**\<serhack>** yes sn0wmonster  
**\<pero>** got it thx  
**\<sn0wmonster>** anyway, who has contacted exchanges about getting Monero added?  
**\<sn0wmonster>** and what exchanges did they contact? is Monero a registered company that does that sort of thing or is it relying on the community to do it?  
**\<sn0wmonster>** is this something fluffypony tends to handle?  
**\<pigeons>** no  
**\<sgp>** @sn0wmonster contacting more local news is something that should be prioritized. We need more resources explaining how to do this effectively  
**\<serhack>** yes  
**\<sgp>** thanks for the suggestion  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** afaik, Kraken added it of their own free will, without ever contacting anyone  
**\<joro>** yes  
**\<cryptochangement>** sn0wmonster monero is not a company, it is just software with a community. I thought that was clear  
**\<moneromooo>** pigeons has a point.  
**\<serhack>** cryptocurrency in italy is like a "mysterious world"  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** and for the PoW discussion, it's mostly concern trolling and some 3-day accounts in that discussion  
**\<moneromax>** As much as I hate all the pontificating I hear elsewhere about "governance", herding Monero cats is super hard.  
**\<sgp>** I think university newspapers are the low-hanging fruit that are more open to ideas like this  
**\<sn0wmonster>** sgp: agreed. i already write copy for the #Neo900 project and my own #taskhive (decentralized p2p freelancer marketplace application i will be using Monero as the default payment method for), i don't mind helping to write poignant copy for Monero to exchanges and news outlets  
**\<sn0wmonster>** serhack, crypto in peru is nonexistent. Paypal is only now making the move from "obvious scam because not physical cash" to "okay maybe i can us eit for only $1 at a time"  
**\<cryptochangement>** sgp university newspapers is genious!  
**\<sn0wmonster>** there is no point in focusing marketing crypto to second-world, third-world or closed-minded countries.  
**\<sgp>** I need help contacting mine though, since I don't know how  
**\<DaveyJones>** we rather need a network of informed journalists that truly know monero is about ... and not only say "muh, anon"  
**\<sn0wmonster>** the wealthy and the industry leaders are the targets  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** sn0wmonster you raise good points  
**\<sn0wmonster>** after that, everyone copies  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** ^^  
**\<serhack>** a lot of journalists are scared by cryptocurrency  
**\<serhack>** especially the chaos of bitcoin and forks  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** focus on targets that have a good chance of liking it  
**\<sn0wmonster>** that's history  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** then they can become leaders  
**\<sgp>** Maybe I can talk to the BEN members about their successes with that  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** and so on  
**\<sn0wmonster>** Monero is not bitcoin, that is it's greatest strength  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** sheeple will be the last  
**\<DaveyJones>** sth like "paid" stories but those stories are about the benefits only no selling  
**\<sn0wmonster>** when people ask "what about \_\_\_\_?", the answer is "Monero is not bitcoin".  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** you don't market to sheeple, you market to shepards :)  
**\<sn0wmonster>** you market to wolves actually, the shephards just learn it because they have to be ahead of the wolves  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** cryptonaire- did some impact with paid PR from his pocket  
**\<cryptochangement>** sn0wmonster honestly it seems like most people view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as all the same  
**\<rehrar>** There is a fundamental misunderstanding here regarding workgroups, the monero community, and even #monero-community  
**\<sn0wmonster>** cryptochangement, and when they do that to others things, we call them racist, bias, etc. there's no reason to cater to the ignorant.  
**\<sn0wmonster>** lead by example and be proud, not shaky and greedy like a crack addict  
**\<sgp>** 5 more minutes. Make your final thoughts heard!  
**\<moneromax>** hey, another slogan idea:  "free money!" (as in freedom)  
**\<sn0wmonster>** there is zero excuse for a "sponsorship of events" other than a money grab. if you want the world using Monero, tell the world, don't 'sell it'  
**\<sn0wmonster>** it is the only lightweight private coin  
**\<serhack>** this is a great meeting :)  
**\<sn0wmonster>** everything else is a ton of overhead (zcash?????), an unproven and unconventional fork, and no where near as slick as Monero  
**\<sn0wmonster>** Monero attracted me because of open transactions  
**\<sgp>** I used the slogan "Safe money for everyone" in the final copy of my presentation (which you should definitely check out!)  
**\<sn0wmonster>** when you have people who understand accounting making accounting currency software, that's a blessing  
**\<ProkhorZ>** @sgp Gideon Gallasch from the Blockchainhotel in Essen asked me if Monero wanted to sponsor his conference.  
**\<sn0wmonster>** it's an additional blessing that they appreciate class  
**\<sn0wmonster>** don't ruin it people  
**\<cryptochangement>** sn0wmonster the only problem with that is, sadly not all that many people know about cryptocurrencies. If you just think about yourself as better than everyone else who is "ignorant" because they are uninformed you will have a real problem. I can say with confidence that i only know maybe 4 people at most who have heard about "that bitcoin thing", which is why people need to be e  
**\<sgp>** @ProkhorZ wow. Really?  
**\<cryptochangement>** ducated as the word spreads  
**\<ProkhorZ>** I dont know whether that would be worth it  
**\<moneromax>** funny how everyone is asking Monero for money, rather than offering to donate.  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** cryptochangement thing is those "ignorant" people follow some other more influential people  
**\<sn0wmonster>** cryptochangement, so educate them. what is Monero's logo on a car going to do?  
**\<sgp>** The conference costs several hundred for each seat. They need more money?  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** you don't want to waste energy  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** so focus on trend-setters  
**\<sn0wmonster>** yes  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** leaders  
**\<sn0wmonster>** start at the source  
**\<JollyMort[m]>** influencers  
**\<DaveyJones>** ProkhorZ no clue what kind of event that is ... im having the fear its close to a "salesman" thing  
**\<ProkhorZ>** @sgp Yes, I went to his meetup  
**\<sn0wmonster>** get into media, not as a client, but as a producer.  
**\<DaveyJones>** i get facebook Ads for that !  
**\<sn0wmonster>** news news news  
**\<sn0wmonster>** the price of bitcoin is controlled by news. that should be obvious by now.  
**\<cryptochangement>** sn0wmonster i was just speaking in general ;)  
**\<sgp>** @ProkhorZ PM me on Reddit (/u/SamsungGalaxyPlayer) and we will discuss this. I will try contacting Gideon  
**\<rupee>** contolled by new. lol  
**\<sgp>** This is not quite what I was expecting  
**\<DaveyJones>** and if i get facebook ads about some blockchainhotel that is concerning... in the light off every other facebook ads about cryptos are also scammy or eToro  
**\<rehrar>** let's formally end the meeting for now  
**\<rupee>** price of bitcoin is controlled by family offices and hedge funds  
**\<sgp>** Yes. It is time to end the meeting  
**\<sgp>** 9. Confirm next meeting date/time  
**\<sgp>** There is a change in the meeting schedule! To address many concerns people have voiced, the next meeting will be on 2 September at 17:00 UTC. It will be the Saturday before the dev meetings. Furthermore, I hope the earlier time will help people in the eastern hemisphere.  
**\<cryptochangement>** sgp sounds good to me!  
**\<sgp>** We will evaluate whether this is a good decision in a few weeks  
**\<sgp>** 10. Conclusion  
**\<sgp>** That’s all! Thanks for attending this Monero Community meeting, and we hope to see you on /r/MoneroCommunity and monero-community. Take care, and know that change starts with YOU.  
**\<sgp>** Good discussions all around
