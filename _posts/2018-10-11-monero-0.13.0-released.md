### Overview

This is the v0.13.0 release of the Monero software. This major release is due to the October 18th network update, which in turn enabled Bulletproofs for reduced transaction sizes, sets the ringsize globally to 11 for uniformity of transactions, updated the PoW algorithm to CNv2, and finally sets the max transaction size at half of the penalty free block size. This release of the software presents a number of major improvements to Monero, as well as a large set of bug fixes.

Some highlights of this major release are:

- New Docker file for 64 bit Android
