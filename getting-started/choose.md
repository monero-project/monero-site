### Mobile, Web, and Lightweight Clients

The clients below are ideal if you are using Monero for the first time. They are also useful if you are on a device that cannot run a [full Monero node](/getting-started/running).

{:.text-center .client-list #mymonero}

{:.text-center}
[MyMonero.com](https://mymonero.com) is easy-to-use and works in your browser without you needing to install anything.  
It can be used with some measure of safety, as MyMonero are unable to spend your funds on your behalf.  
It is owned and operated by Riccardo Spagni, one of the Monero Core Team members.

### Full Monero Client

If you are able to spare the bandwidth and disk space required to run a full node, doing so helps keep the network stable and robust, and also affords you the maximum privacy Monero has to offer.

You can read our guide on [running a Monero node](/getting-started/running), and the Monero core software can be downloaded from the [downloads page](/downloads).

### Third-Party Clients

There are also several third-party clients that interact with the official Monero core daemon, and are able to provide their own additional functionality.
