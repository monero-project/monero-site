We are excited to have Justin Ehrenhofer, a prominent member of the monero community, provide a presentation on monero that the beginner can understand but is also insightful for the most experienced users. Garrett See, CEO of DV Chain, will speak about what he's seeing in the OTC markets. An open bar and a brief networking segment will begin at 5 PM on Thursday, January 11th, and the event will conclude at 7 PM. Barolo will be served.
