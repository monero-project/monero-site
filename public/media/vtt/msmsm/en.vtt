WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.277
I'm Dr. Daniel Kim, Founder and CEO of

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:04.290
Sweetwater Digital Asset Consulting.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.656
This talk is called

00:00:05.657 --> 00:00:08.399
"Sound Money, Safe Mode" and it is a

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.168
broad, big picture introduction

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.193
to cryptocurrency and Monero.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.220
A little bit about myself -- so, academically,

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:16.836
I'm trained as a particle physicist --

00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:19.015
I did my undergraduate and graduate work

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:21.349
in experimental particle physics at Harvard.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.495
There, I had a habit ingrained in me

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:24.710
to always look at data,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.373
so there's going to be a lot of data

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:27.433
shown in this talk.

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:28.708
Most of my career was

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:30.421
spent in the non-profit sector.

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:32.262
My first job out of grad school was with a

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:34.229
symphony orchestra, where I ended up doing about

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.875
700 concerts professionally --

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:38.402
first as a violinist, and then later as a keyboardist.

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:39.851
Concurrently with that,

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:41.420
I jumped through the hoops to become

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.560
board certified in radiation oncology physics.

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:45.590
Then as a medical school professor in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.046
medical physics, I helped about a

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.950
couple thousand patients with their

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.146
fights against cancer, by helping with

00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:53.063
the technical aspects of delivering

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:54.578
high intensity radiation.

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:56.801
It was as a med-school professor that I

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:58.752
did my perhaps most "DEF CON" thing,

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:00.869
which was to invent a device

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.470
that did packet sniffing

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.030
on a medical network to reconstruct

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.350
treatment data being delivered to cancer

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.841
patients just before the time of treatment.

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:11.830
I signed up for the Executive MBA

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.830
program at Yale because I thought that

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.679
I wanted to show an interest in the way

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.670
that the world works

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.749
in a different way than in physics.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:21.270
Of course in physics, you're getting at how

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.068
the world works at the smallest levels

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:25.396
but then to think broadly about "real world"

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:27.429
human problems from a variety of

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.590
perspectives, the MBA is good for that.

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:31.749
While doing that, I made a switch to the

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.796
for-profit sector --

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:35.030
I joined a small hedge fund and I became

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.469
Director of Research there.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.789
I was a co-author of a paper that won

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.789
the top research award of the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.590
CFA Institute.  That paper was about the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.069
effect of liquidity on asset prices.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.910
In my spare time, I was getting more and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.830
more interested into cryptocurrency and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.429
then I made a decision that

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.056
this was a genuine innovation,

00:01:53.057 --> 00:01:54.652
of which there are not that many that happen

00:01:54.653 --> 00:01:56.230
in one's lifetime, so I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.389
jumped to my own small business, which is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.870
what I do now as an independent consultant.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.630
Now I help bridge two very separate worlds

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.286
as the founder and CEO of

00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:07.332
Sweetwater Digital Asset Consulting --

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.378
there's the world that DEF CON

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.469
represents, which is a

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.209
non-commercial, open source,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.750
cypherpunk, grassroots,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.703
cryptocurrency culture --

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:17.909
and on the right side is the very

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.610
parallel universe of

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.350
traditional asset protection,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.610
trust and family office portfolio management,

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:25.110
estate and tax planning.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.249
These two separate worlds know

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.183
very little about each other, in practice --

00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:30.835
they often make assumptions about

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.030
each other that are based in fear --

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.430
and so as one who has significant

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.670
experience on both sides of this divide,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.229
I talk with "OG" crypto guys who want

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.910
guidance in putting together a plan

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.150
to shield their crypto from future

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.589
creditors, whether they be

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.150
random people who might sue them or a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.408
potentially vindictive future ex-spouse --

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:53.247
and then from the other direction,

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:56.016
I talk with traditional portfolio managers

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:58.288
in the trust and estate world who are

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.607
well acquainted with traditional assets,

00:03:00.608 --> 00:03:02.186
have heard about this "cryptocurrency stuff,"

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:03.439
want to know if it's for real,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.670
and want to get in touch with a Sherpa

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.650
who can help them sort through all the noise.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.067
In my non-profit efforts these days

00:03:11.078 --> 00:03:12.735
I am also a community volunteer

00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:14.149
for the Monero project.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.398
My talking here is on a voluntary basis.

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.494
I'm doing this because I personally feel that

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:21.545
this is an important project for humanity.

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:23.589
I think it's important for people to

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.750
speak out and make their voices heard

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:27.268
on matters like this.

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.626
I do not receive any

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:30.147
support from the Monero project,

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.291
I've never asked for support

00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:32.493
from the Monero project --

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.630
I want to maintain my independence, as my

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.430
primary duty is to my consulting clients,

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:39.830
to whom I owe the duty of doing the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.105
research and examination of

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:43.679
the entire cryptocurrency space

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.837
and making recommendations on what I think

00:03:45.848 --> 00:03:48.178
are the most compelling projects out there.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:50.390
Within cryptocurrency, I also specialize

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.390
in tokens that do what I think is the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.597
"killer app" of Nakamoto consensus,

00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:56.017
which is money.

00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:59.454
This talk is called "Sound Money, Safe Mode."

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:01.269
First, I'm going to talk about the pandemic

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.165
and the economic fallout.

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:07.509
Second, the management of fiat scarcity

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.151
leads to a strong suggestion

00:04:10.162 --> 00:04:12.427
that it might be a good time in history

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:13.668
to be looking at

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:15.511
independent sources of scarcity.

00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:17.796
Third, I'll talk about fungibility --

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:20.069
what that means, and why it's important

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.390
as the world moves increasingly towards

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.368
a mass surveillance society.

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:26.779
And then the fourth part is about getting involved.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.171
There's a shallow way to get involved

00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:29.500
and there's a deeper way to get involved.

00:04:29.511 --> 00:04:30.750
The shallow way would be

00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.937
because it's a cryptocurrency,

00:04:31.948 --> 00:04:33.389
it behaves like an asset,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.950
and so I put on my hedge fund hat

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.899
and I look at Monero and Bitcoin,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.717
and also gold, as parts of one's portfolio.

00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:41.828
But the deeper, more significant way

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.990
is getting involved personally with your

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.002
time and energy and expertise.

00:04:46.647 --> 00:04:48.550
I wanted to say thanks to a few people

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.310
in the Monero community who I had

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.310
consulted with while preparing this talk:

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.718
Howard "hyc" Chu, Dr. Sarang Noether

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.486
of the Monero Research Lab, and

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:58.026
Dr. Francisco Cabanas

00:04:58.037 --> 00:04:59.756
of the Monero Core team.

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.789
Here in this plot I'm showing U.S.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.950
government data all the way back to 1980,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.308
so we're looking at 40 years of history here.

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.517
The blue line is "U6" unemployment --

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:11.036
this is the fraction of people

00:05:11.037 --> 00:05:12.310
who are either

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.590
looking for work, or

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.189
working part-time when they want to be

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.749
working full-time, or are so discouraged

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.830
with their state of trying to find a job

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.870
that they've given up.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.994
This is contrasting with "U3,"

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:25.422
which is only counting those people who are

00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:27.848
actively looking for work and can't find it.

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.523
So U6 is a broader measure and so

00:05:29.524 --> 00:05:31.758
it's widely considered to be more accurate.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.849
Unemployment in the year 2020

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.670
spiked up to the highest level

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.577
ever in recorded history -- at least

00:05:37.578 --> 00:05:39.830
of the U6 unemployment rate --

00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:41.887
it spiked up to about 23 percent.

00:05:41.888 --> 00:05:43.392
Fortunately that's gone down a bit

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:44.710
since then, but it's still

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.576
definitely not a pretty number.

00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:49.331
So demand for services like

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:51.029
travel, entertainment -- all

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.189
fell through the floor -- and so the

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.710
federal government's reaction to that

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.270
was to be concerned about deflation.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.128
To fight that, they expanded the money supply,

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:01.355
because by printing money,

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:03.400
that reduces the interest rate, then it becomes

00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:05.005
less attractive to save your money

00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:06.756
and get a tiny bit of interest, and it becomes

00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:08.784
more attractive to spend your money.

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:10.194
Here in green is the

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:13.110
MZM money supply -- MZM stands for

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.727
"money zero maturity"

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:16.807
and what that consists of is the

00:06:16.808 --> 00:06:19.590
M1 supply -- which is coins, currency,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.990
and checking accounts -- and it combines

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.909
that with savings accounts and

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.510
money market accounts, which many people

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.848
use as an alternate form of a

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.309
savings account these days.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.444
I've normalized that number to the gross

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:32.150
domestic product -- that is the value of

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.670
all goods and services produced in the

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.270
U.S. in one year.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.390
The money supply as a fraction of the

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.990
productive output of the U.S.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.859
has been going up for the last forty years,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.672
and you can see here at 2020

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:45.189
the line spikes up from

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.150
about 70 percent to over 100 percent.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.324
The word "unprecedented" gets thrown around a lot

00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:52.356
for this crisis, but truly, if you look at

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:53.895
long-term plots like this and you see

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:55.510
the size and the slope

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.270
of this money printing that's been

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.629
happening in the last several months --

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.482
it's truly breathtaking.

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:02.192
Of course the government can

00:07:02.193 --> 00:07:04.706
print as much or as little money as it wants,

00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:06.070
with nothing stopping them from

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.510
doing whatever they want --

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.182
this has been true since [President] Nixon abolished

00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:12.844
the linkage of the U.S. dollar to gold.

00:07:13.088 --> 00:07:14.550
Looking at the bottom line here,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.230
this is how much money is the U.S.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.350
government taking in

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.950
minus how much money is the U.S.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.870
government spending, on a monthly basis.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.350
So, it's basically taxes minus spending.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.110
It spikes four times a year because

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.790
that's when estimated taxes are due

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.222
and so there's that seasonal structure to it.

00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:31.266
As you can see it really tanked,

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.918
in especially quarter 2 of 2020.

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.990
April 15, which is the normal deadline

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.830
for taxes to be due, got pushed back to

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.749
July 15, due to the pandemic.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.749
So there was no tax revenue coming in,

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.689
yet the government was continuing to spend

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.150
money as it was before.

00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:46.309
The spending didn't stop,

00:07:46.338 --> 00:07:48.161
just the income stopped.

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:50.390
And so this might reverse itself,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.564
now that July 15 has come and gone,

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:55.612
with a correspondingly high spike in taxes --

00:07:55.613 --> 00:07:58.709
that is assuming that this July 15 was a bonanza

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.090
from the point of view of the IRS

00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:01.282
with a whole lot of tax money coming in --

00:08:01.283 --> 00:08:03.129
we'll see if that was actually the case.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.400
If you integrate this over time,

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:07.139
then you get the black line

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.710
that's on top, which is the

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.699
total federal debt normalized to GDP, again.

00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:13.930
In the aftermath of the

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:16.824
2008-2009 financial crisis,

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.373
the government was spending

00:08:18.374 --> 00:08:19.507
quite a bit more money

00:08:19.508 --> 00:08:20.675
than it was collecting,

00:08:20.676 --> 00:08:22.897
and as a result, when you time integrate that,

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:24.177
you get the black line up here

00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:26.473
in the federal debt to GDP.

00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:28.769
And now we're at this point here

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.151
at the beginning of the year --

00:08:30.152 --> 00:08:32.958
the debt to GDP ratio is about 110 percent

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.689
and that is before the pandemic.

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.790
In the G20, there are eight countries

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.230
that have been reporting

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.389
statistics on the amount of money that's

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:45.014
in circulation in their particular currency.

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:47.269
Here, I've normalized the amount of money

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.470
in every country to be

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.670
equal to 1 on January of 2020.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.670
There's this hockey stick shape to this

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.710
curve of how much money is circulating.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.479
In the United States, the M1 expansion has been

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.239
to the tune of about 1.33 trillion dollars --

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.642
which amounts to a

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:04.962
increase in the money supply of about

00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:07.269
300 million dollars per hour.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.110
Now, if you compare this to, for example,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.870
the market cap of Monero -- that's

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.276
something on the order of one and a half billion --

00:09:13.277 --> 00:09:15.269
so the money supply of the U.S.

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:19.039
expanded by the size of Monero's market cap,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.852
roughly five times every day

00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:23.181
for the last six months.

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:26.310
Let's broaden our focus to not just the

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.639
eight countries in the G20 that have reported

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.389
results recently, but let's look at

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.070
all the G20 fiat currencies

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.550
and let's also expand the time frame

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.709
in which we're looking back to 2009,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.039
the year in which Bitcoin came out.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.350
Every country's money is equal to 1

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.949
at the beginning of 2009.

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.790
You can see that there's not one of the

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.110
G20 currencies that has been flat

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.832
or has actually decreased their

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:49.870
money supply over time --

00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:51.849
it's all increased.

00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:53.990
As a former med-school professor

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.690
who worked in oncology,

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.350
the exponential math of

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.509
uncontrolled growth in cancerous tumors

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:00.732
is something that I think about

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.550
when I see a plot like this.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.134
Pre-pandemic, we're looking at a

00:10:04.135 --> 00:10:05.910
doubling time of about 8 years.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.670
If you think about how long does an

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.870
average human survive, let's say 80 years--

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.780
that is 10 doubling times,

00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.230
which means the amount of

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.230
money expansion in an average human's

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.990
lifetime is 2 to the 10th power,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.389
which is 1,024 -- it's about a thousand

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.406
times increase in the money supply.

00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:25.119
And that is before the pandemic --

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.550
after the pandemic, we're looking at a

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.269
doubling time that's closer to two years.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.110
There's an interesting scholarly book

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.949
called "Monetary Regimes and Inflation"

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:36.150
which did a study of 29 historical cases

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.910
of hyperinflation.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.829
At least for Americans, none of us have

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.829
ever had to live through that, but all

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.430
accounts of what it is like to

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.630
survive through something like that is

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.710
it's no fun at all -- it wipes out people's

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.990
savings, it promotes

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.870
social unrest -- it's just not pretty.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.190
This book came to the conclusion that

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.762
in 25 out of 29 of these

00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:56.747
historical cases of hyperinflation,

00:10:56.748 --> 00:10:58.126
the trigger was that there was

00:10:58.127 --> 00:10:59.266
money creation

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:01.855
that financed government deficits.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.509
These charts should be convincing

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.110
evidence that the money creation --

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.673
which is half of this equation --

00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:08.470
is indeed happening.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.613
The second half is the government deficits --

00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:12.799
so unless governments are able to make

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.870
extremely difficult decisions and are

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.230
able to balance their budgets,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.150
now we're going to have two out of two

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.310
of these criteria met.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.949
The conclusion of people that the money

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:23.990
is no longer

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.550
trustable and must be spent immediately

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.550
otherwise it lose value --

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.630
that decision, which needs to take place

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.150
among an entire population

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.348
in order for hyperinflation to take place --

00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:35.838
it's a social thing.

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:37.829
It's the herd that decides that they

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.627
don't have confidence in the money any more,

00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.924
it's hard to predict.  So,

00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:42.630
it's not a foregone conclusion

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.069
that money creation plus government

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.150
deficits means hyperinflation or

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.269
increased inflation --

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.696
but it certainly doesn't help.

00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:51.829
The takeaway for anyone with

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:54.870
assets to save is that it might be wise

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.430
to consider the possibility that the

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.629
future might hold

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.894
higher inflation than what you are used to,

00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:02.230
and indeed what you might be

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.790
comfortable with.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.629
In a hyperinflation scenario, there have

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.389
been independent sources of scarcity

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.878
that have been looked at to

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.773
store wealth.  Physical commodities,

00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:12.949
for example, gold and silver --

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.710
these are the classic ones.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.473
And since 2009,

00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:18.470
there's a new option for humanity,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.389
that is in the form of digital commodities,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.879
which became possible to consider

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.492
after the development of the

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.134
Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin white paper.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.030
Let's contrast digital fiat versus

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.776
decentralized digital scarcity

00:12:32.777 --> 00:12:34.790
like Bitcoin and Monero.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.278
Fiat money is a source of digital scarcity,

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.870
it's just that that scarcity is

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.430
controlled by a centralized entity.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.230
Access to the database of who owns what

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.629
is protected -- there's a moat of firewalls

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.670
around that.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.415
Once you have access, you have

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:51.509
quite a bit of ability to change things.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.558
At the lower level, like at a bank teller level,

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:54.497
of course you can't just

00:12:54.498 --> 00:12:55.910
create money out of thin air.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.389
As you go up in the system, the amount of

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:00.389
power that you have over that database

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:02.150
becomes higher, so that now you get to

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.910
the level of the Federal Reserve Bank --

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.069
it becomes arbitrary write access to

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.590
this ledger.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.110
And of course the software that controls

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.710
this is closed source -- why would they

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.710
open source it -- that would facilitate bad

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.110
actors learning how the system works.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.389
There are downsides to this;

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:18.310
mismanagement is probably the chief one --

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.750
all these plots that I was showing of

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.069
the money supply could be interpreted as

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:23.590
signs of mismanagement.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.590
The Federal Reserve is supposed to be

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.870
imposing discipline,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.030
independent of the political process --

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.790
the Federal Reserve is supposed to be the

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.069
entity that says

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:34.150
"no, I'm sorry, please don't look to us to

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.150
be manufacturing money out of thin air,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.829
because that's not sustainable."

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:39.030
That's what the Federal Reserve is

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.012
supposed to do.

00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:41.795
It's not really doing that.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.470
There's also insider abuse that is a

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.990
problem with these sorts of centralized

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.110
security models.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.350
There are plenty of examples of large

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.389
banks that do

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.550
egregious things to abuse the trust of

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.150
their customers and get away with it

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.829
with just a slap on the wrist.

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:58.230
Basically, you have middlemen between

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.910
the people and the database --

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.444
these middlemen who are in a position

00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:02.608
of power -- and so there's

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:04.556
little incentive to improve.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.389
So, the decentralized security model of

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.573
Bitcoin, and also Monero,

00:14:07.574 --> 00:14:09.030
is totally different.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.875
In these decentralized networks,

00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:12.618
anyone can join the peer-to-peer network.

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:15.030
Anyone can download the Monero code,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.269
run it on their computer, and become part

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.870
of this network which

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.069
does the functions of what a bank does.

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.150
So in contrast to the centralized

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.150
security model where you have a master

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.348
database sitting in the middle

00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:29.430
with all sorts of firewalls and protections

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.309
around it to try and defend it from misuse,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.110
here each node has its own copy of the

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.735
database that contains a record of

00:14:36.736 --> 00:14:38.870
who sent what to who.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.949
In the decentralized security model it's

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.870
open source -- it would have to be --

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.629
if anyone is able to join the

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.070
peer-to-peer network, you'd better

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:47.360
make your code open source,

00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:48.371
because otherwise,

00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:49.933
how do you know what you're running?

00:14:50.148 --> 00:14:51.670
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar," the

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.509
classic open source software development

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.269
book that contrasts the building of a

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:57.030
cathedral -- which is a centralized

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.657
process a la Microsoft --

00:14:58.658 --> 00:15:00.470
versus the bazaar -- which is

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.389
a farmers' market where everyone is free

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.976
to show up and just build something --

00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:06.041
which would be the Linux model.

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:07.478
These two situations --

00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:09.306
fiat versus decentralized money --

00:15:09.307 --> 00:15:11.728
it's really like Microsoft versus Linux.

00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:13.829
Of course there are downsides to use of

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:16.066
FOSS in money; it's new,

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:17.829
fewer people have heard of it.

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:20.069
It's relatively inefficient, because if

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:22.069
there's no "boss" computer within this

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.110
peer-to-peer network,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.710
then how are you going to decide what

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.790
the true version is of the database that

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.149
keeps track of who owns what?

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.285
Currently, cryptocurrencies are

00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:34.808
able to be traded for fiat currencies,

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.958
but this used to not be the case.

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:40.479
Back in 2009, Bitcoin had zero dollar value.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.430
It was this interesting curiosity of a

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.350
system that purported to

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.250
make a new form of scarcity

00:15:47.251 --> 00:15:48.629
that acted like money.

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.710
But back in 2009, nobody knew that

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.230
that was actually the case;

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.150
nobody knew if this thing would actually

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.990
work like it said it would work.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.773
And so, I think it's a good idea,

00:15:57.774 --> 00:15:59.430
if you're new to cryptocurrency --

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.350
before you get caught up in the latest

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.030
price movement of this and that currency

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.389
and the horse race --

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.550
I would suggest pretending that all of

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.389
cryptocurrency has zero value.

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.259
It'll end up being good for you in the long run

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.518
because you'll have a more solid

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.147
understanding of what's actually going on

00:16:13.148 --> 00:16:15.599
with this stuff that you're buying and selling.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.992
Now there are three aspects that

00:16:16.993 --> 00:16:18.471
you need to get working

00:16:18.472 --> 00:16:20.502
to create a private form of money.

00:16:20.503 --> 00:16:22.683
First, you have to have some sense of

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:25.359
what is the analogy of a bank account.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.269
Second, is you need to have some analogy

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:28.949
to what it is to write a check --

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:31.030
and third, you need to have some sort of

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.270
process for that check,

00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:33.846
once it's shown to be legitimate,

00:16:33.847 --> 00:16:35.700
to be processed through the system.

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.629
So, I'd like to turn the clock back and

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.898
summarize how Bitcoin works.

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:43.509
Bitcoin is based on the secp256k1 elliptic

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:45.430
curve, and that's written out here --

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.350
it's public knowledge what this elliptic

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.710
curve is, there's nothing secret about it,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.069
it's a public standard:

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:52.337
y squared is congruent to x cubed plus 7,

00:16:52.338 --> 00:16:54.790
mod this very large prime number.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.269
x and y, usually, you think of as being

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.514
real numbers -- think of

00:16:58.515 --> 00:16:59.749
high school algebra, and you

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.430
want to plot this curve, you'll make a

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.949
curvy shape out of this --

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.645
but in this case, we're restricting

00:17:04.646 --> 00:17:06.150
x and y to be integers.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.309
And furthermore, these integers are

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.577
modulus this prime number,

00:17:09.578 --> 00:17:11.601
which is basically clock arithmetic --

00:17:11.602 --> 00:17:12.817
this is saying that 1 o'clock,

00:17:12.818 --> 00:17:14.335
13 o'clock, 25 o'clock

00:17:14.336 --> 00:17:16.599
are all the same, because every 12,

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.390
your counting goes back.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.961
So that's the case here, except

00:17:19.962 --> 00:17:21.632
instead of a clock with 12 numbers,

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:22.789
you have a clock with a

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:24.567
70-some digit prime number of

00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:26.470
numbers on its dial.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.870
You have this universe-sized sheet of

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.051
grid paper with (x,y) coordinates

00:17:31.052 --> 00:17:32.798
that are each integers --

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:35.510
and some of the points on this gigantic

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.590
sheet of grid paper are solutions to

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.830
this particular elliptic curve.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.390
If one was to try to guess random

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.909
combinations of x and y

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.600
to come up with a solution to this,

00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:47.190
it's basically impossible.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.710
So fortunately, part of the elliptic curve

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.789
definition is to provide you with

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.470
a solution called the base point.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.590
The base point is a solution --

00:17:54.591 --> 00:17:56.230
x sub b, y sub b -- which

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.710
is known to solve this equation.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.310
And furthermore, because of the mathematics

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.350
of elliptic curves,

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.321
if somebody gives you an integer n,

00:18:03.322 --> 00:18:04.710
it's possible to compute

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.750
another solution, P sub n, which would be

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.139
n times the base point.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.403
It's not just that you take

00:18:10.404 --> 00:18:12.070
the base point and you multiply

00:18:12.087 --> 00:18:13.646
both the x and y coordinates by the number n,

00:18:13.647 --> 00:18:15.270
it's more sophisticated than that.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.150
But the idea is, if somebody tells you n,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.354
you can compute the n-th point

00:18:20.355 --> 00:18:22.479
that is a solution to the elliptic curve.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.724
It's a one-way function --

00:18:23.725 --> 00:18:25.152
so if someone tells you n,

00:18:25.153 --> 00:18:26.296
you can get P sub n,

00:18:26.297 --> 00:18:27.647
but if someone tells you P sub n,

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.830
you can't get n, you have to brute force that.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.412
To brute force this, is a 10 to the 70th

00:18:32.413 --> 00:18:33.706
chance of getting it right,

00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:36.070
which means, might as well just not try.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.778
The location of that point,

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:39.909
translated to a string of

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.760
letters and numbers, is the Bitcoin address.

00:18:42.761 --> 00:18:44.443
At the heart of it, a Bitcoin address

00:18:44.444 --> 00:18:46.376
is representing an (x,y) coordinate

00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:49.350
on the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.612
The number n is the private key,

00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:52.630
that's the secret --

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.190
and knowing that number n is the

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.110
authorized signature to spend

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.899
the money that is associated with

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.005
the public key, P sub n.

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.079
They're linked to each other,

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.862
so that's why it's not like a password

00:19:03.863 --> 00:19:05.068
where you can just change

00:19:05.069 --> 00:19:06.558
the numbers that you're assigned --

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.909
it doesn't work like that, there's a math

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.029
equation behind it --

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:10.950
so if somebody forgets their secret,

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.470
there's no recourse.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.230
Getting a new Bitcoin account really

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.669
means you're picking a number --

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:16.849
you're picking a number

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.270
in this vast numeric field.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.169
You're calling that number yours.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.669
Just like Coca-Cola keeps the formula to

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:25.773
its soft drink secret,

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.372
it's this piece of information

00:19:27.373 --> 00:19:29.680
that you can write on an index card.

00:19:29.681 --> 00:19:31.032
You, and you alone,

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:32.710
are the person who knows

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.590
the existence of this one certain point

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.888
on the elliptic curve which is yours.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.077
So if you are in possession of a

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.909
public-private key pair

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.669
and you have a message that you want to

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.750
send to the world, and you want to make

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.537
sure that everyone in the world knows that

00:19:47.538 --> 00:19:49.999
that message came from you, and only you --

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.166
you would take your message,

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:52.624
combine it with your private key,

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:53.647
to produce a signature --

00:19:53.648 --> 00:19:55.830
which is a block of bytes that is unique

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.310
to the combination of the message

00:19:57.311 --> 00:19:58.668
and the private key.

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:00.150
Then you would send your message

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.272
and you would include with your

00:20:01.273 --> 00:20:02.808
plaintext message the signature,

00:20:02.809 --> 00:20:05.722
which is this byte block that you generated.

00:20:06.027 --> 00:20:07.427
As a recipient now,

00:20:07.428 --> 00:20:08.630
you get this message

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.230
and you got the signature from the

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.318
purported sender,

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:13.159
and you combine this with the public key

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.430
which you know to be from the sender.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.781
When you combine all three of those,

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:18.808
you get a binary verification result that says,

00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:20.271
"yes" this was a legitimate message

00:20:20.272 --> 00:20:22.630
from the sender, or "no" it was not.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.630
This kind of message signing happens in

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.470
a variety of computing contexts --

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.029
for example, HTTPS uses this --

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.470
here we're just using it in a

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.604
self-contained financial accounting system.

00:20:33.605 --> 00:20:35.029
"Sending Bitcoin" means

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:37.270
that you're sending this signed message,

00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:38.710
analogous to a check.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.666
So interestingly,

00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:41.238
knowledge of the private key,

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:43.430
which is a form of speech,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.628
is now tantamount to money.

00:20:45.629 --> 00:20:47.100
It's kind of an attractive thing

00:20:47.101 --> 00:20:48.643
for the era that we're living in,

00:20:48.644 --> 00:20:51.270
the idea that knowledge of something can,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.581
in itself, be cash.

00:20:54.064 --> 00:20:56.230
Once you have a person who has a

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.590
Bitcoin account and they

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.805
sign a message saying

00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:00.419
"I want to spend this bitcoin,"

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.655
who's going to do the processing,

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.430
who's going to make sure it's legit?

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.823
That is done by a network of miners in Bitcoin.

00:21:05.824 --> 00:21:08.179
So "miners" are just a word for

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.937
peer-to-peer Bitcoin accountants --

00:21:09.938 --> 00:21:11.699
there is no "boss" computer,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.356
they are all equal.

00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:15.688
So how do they settle disputes?

00:21:15.689 --> 00:21:17.614
Basically, they gossip a lot,

00:21:17.615 --> 00:21:20.055
and they do majority rules.

00:21:20.056 --> 00:21:21.787
And so each of these accountants,

00:21:21.788 --> 00:21:24.245
when they receive a spend message,

00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:26.142
they will check it, and if it's legit,

00:21:26.143 --> 00:21:27.685
then they will pass that message on

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.779
to their compatriots.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.350
A block is simply a list

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.843
of valid signed spend messages.

00:21:33.844 --> 00:21:34.950
In each block

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.560
there is a small data field called the nonce

00:21:37.561 --> 00:21:39.590
that each miner is free to fill

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.310
with whatever random bits they want.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.089
A block is not accepted

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.990
by the network until

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.310
the hash of the block is lower than a

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.789
certain number, called the difficulty.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:52.029
The difficulty number is

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.390
dynamically adjusted so that the

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.549
number of valid blocks that happened in a

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:59.270
10-minute interval is 1, on average.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.470
This is something that's hard to get

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.510
your head around if this is the first

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.710
time you're hearing it, because usually

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.390
when you think about hash functions, you

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.990
don't care about the value of what the

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.590
hash is -- you just care that the hash

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.029
matches something else.

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.230
For example, if you're checking the

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.990
download of a file, you want to take a

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.590
hash of what it is you downloaded and

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.029
check that against the hash of what you

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:16.390
think you downloaded and make sure that

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.590
they match.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.590
Here in this case, we actually care if

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.270
the hash starts with a zero

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.669
or a one -- in fact, we care about the first

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:25.430
several digits of the hash, and we will

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.830
require them to all be zeros.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.207
So each of these miners

00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:31.270
is going to try repeatedly --

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.163
and most often fail --

00:22:33.164 --> 00:22:34.639
to find a nonce

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.659
that causes a block of spend messages

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.669
to be considered valid.

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:41.703
You have this worldwide network of computers.

00:22:41.704 --> 00:22:43.430
Each of them is churning away,

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.968
brute force guessing different

00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:46.470
values of the nonce.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.230
One of them will eventually succeed and

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.359
come up with a block that satisfies the difficulty.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.397
The computer in the network that does that

00:22:53.398 --> 00:22:54.710
gets what's called the block reward,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.618
that is a bitcoin payout to the nonce solver.

00:22:57.619 --> 00:22:59.350
Once all of the computers in the world

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.270
get news of this new block --

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.851
again, because the accountants here

00:23:02.852 --> 00:23:03.923
are very gossipy --

00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:06.789
then they clear out the pending transactions

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:08.390
in their own queues with the

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.070
transactions that have been ratified in

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.430
this new block, and then they continue

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.350
working on the next block.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.950
And it's important to know that all of

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.789
the money came into existence as a

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:18.870
payout to a computer in the network that

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.710
was helping to secure the accounting and

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.870
the bookkeeping for that network.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.430
None of the block reward in Bitcoin was

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.260
shunted off and a cut went to a

00:23:27.261 --> 00:23:28.390
group of people, or

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.230
to a foundation, or used to do marketing.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.149
And this is relevant from a regulatory

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:35.669
point of view because FinCEN,

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:37.270
which is one of the financial regulators

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.190
in the U.S., defines a decentralized

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.950
cryptocurrency as a currency in which

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.345
the block rewards all go

00:23:42.346 --> 00:23:43.993
directly to the decentralized network

00:23:43.994 --> 00:23:45.430
that's doing the accounting.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.590
That's important because if you have a

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.872
chunk of money that's going to a group of people,

00:23:49.873 --> 00:23:50.950
then that group of people

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.470
could be considered as being the

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.070
masterminds of the operation,

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.984
so subject to increased regulation

00:23:55.985 --> 00:23:59.010
in terms of AML/KYC rules.

00:23:59.011 --> 00:24:01.127
So again, there's no one "boss" computer

00:24:01.128 --> 00:24:02.710
that is in charge of having the

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.390
correct version of the ledger.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.909
If you have a conflict in the network,

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.230
who wins?  Well, the answer is that the

00:24:08.231 --> 00:24:10.710
chain with more hash power is going to be

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.149
the one that is deemed to be the

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.431
authoritative version of the blockchain.

00:24:14.432 --> 00:24:16.950
So this functions as a self-healing mechanism

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.149
if there's a discrepancy

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:20.499
in the state of the network.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.941
So to summarize the Bitcoin white paper:

00:24:21.942 --> 00:24:25.029
Nakamoto consensus synthesizes digital scarcity.

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:27.077
There's a few different kinds of scarcity.

00:24:27.078 --> 00:24:28.630
One is account level scarcity,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.373
that is, the establishment of property rights

00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:32.284
in this system of accounting --

00:24:32.285 --> 00:24:33.350
so that is enforced in Bitcoin

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.990
by the users -- the individual's

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.974
selection and subsequent protection

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:40.261
of an elliptic curve private key.

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.669
How do we know that we're not going to

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:43.350
have a situation like we have in fiat

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.710
banking, where we have

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.789
a money supply whose quantity is

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.789
unpredictable over time, and is subject

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:50.950
to the decisions of a central group with

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.430
arbitrary control of that money supply?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.590
That is enforced by an open network of

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.510
peer-to-peer accountants who are

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.430
rewarded for behaving consistently with

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.111
the consensus ruleset.

00:25:01.712 --> 00:25:03.657
The majority of nodes in Bitcoin

00:25:03.658 --> 00:25:06.219
have coded in advance that the total number of

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.350
bitcoins that are going to be

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.269
rewarded to miners is going to be a

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:11.743
total sum of 21 million bitcoin.

00:25:11.915 --> 00:25:13.909
You need majority decisions on

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:16.630
this network to be considered correct,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.310
that's how you get around the fact that

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.310
there's no "boss" computer -- basically the

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.870
majority rules becomes the boss --

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.630
and so a rogue computer that's

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.319
introduced to the network is going to have

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.549
zero effect on it -- unless it can manage

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:30.276
to get 51 percent of the hash power,

00:25:30.277 --> 00:25:33.105
which is expensive and difficult to do.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.269
Finally you have database modification

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:37.750
scarcity, which is record permanence.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.110
Every single block in the Bitcoin

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.110
blockchain has a low hash number,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.110
and so that makes each piece of data

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.710
that gets added to the blockchain

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.143
a rare piece of data.

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.963
It took a lot of trial and error,

00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:50.018
in other words, it took a lot of proof-of-work

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.470
to get that data added to the blockchain,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.870
and so it's extraordinarily difficult

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.110
to make modifications to that database --

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.110
especially as time goes on

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.110
and more proof of work gets piled on top

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.393
of the older transactions.

00:26:03.991 --> 00:26:05.750
Okay, so let's contrast that with the

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.750
scarcity features of Monero.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.510
Monero is not a code fork of Bitcoin --

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.126
most important when assessing,

00:26:13.127 --> 00:26:15.036
is Monero something worth considering

00:26:15.037 --> 00:26:17.689
given that Bitcoin was there first --

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.430
most cryptocurrencies simply

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.510
did a copy-paste of Bitcoin's code and

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.470
then made a few,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.470
often times trivial, changes and then

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.323
publish that and call it your own cryptocurrency.

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:30.798
One criterion that one can use to whittle down

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:33.110
the subset of cryptocurrencies that are

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.805
worth considering, is this:

00:26:34.806 --> 00:26:36.374
is it simply a Bitcoin fork?

00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:37.687
How much original

00:26:37.688 --> 00:26:39.430
intellectual effort went into the

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.269
creation of this other cryptocurrency?

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:43.684
In Monero it has its own separate codebase.

00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:44.950
In fact, it uses a completely

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.789
different elliptic curve than Bitcoin:

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:48.775
Monero uses ed25519.

00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:50.549
That is, the (x,y) points

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.390
on this gigantic sheet of grid paper --

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.310
which is fundamental to how the

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.669
cryptocurrency works --

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.590
that very equation is different in

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.510
Monero than it is in Bitcoin.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.669
To the extent that the elliptic curve

00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:02.950
used in Bitcoin

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.310
may or may not have weaknesses

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.909
associated with it -- this is a form of

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:07.590
technical hedging in which Monero has

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.158
chosen, deliberately, a different elliptic curve.

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:12.070
In Monero, there are two private keys:

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.830
there's a spend key and a view key.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.590
The spend key works like the Bitcoin

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.669
private key -- if you know the spend key,

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.999
you are in complete control of your account.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.194
There's a second key, the view key, which is

00:27:22.195 --> 00:27:24.719
a cryptographic subset of the spend key --

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.073
if you know the view key then you can

00:27:27.074 --> 00:27:29.224
look at details of transactions

00:27:29.225 --> 00:27:31.029
that you were involved in.

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:33.190
One of the misconceptions about Monero is

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.950
it's just this completely secret box

00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:36.070
so you can tell nothing about

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.497
about what's going on in it.

00:27:37.506 --> 00:27:39.490
You can actually share details of what's

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.510
going on in your particular Monero account

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.844
if you share your view key.

00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:45.669
It offers opt-in transparency.

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.987
In Monero the address space is larger:

00:27:47.988 --> 00:27:50.487
10 to the 76th different addresses to choose

00:27:50.488 --> 00:27:53.350
from, versus 10 to the 60th in Bitcoin.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.590
This means that there is more security

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.510
in terms of the birthday problem.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.370
When one is choosing a cryptocurrency account,

00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:00.953
one is simply picking a point

00:28:00.954 --> 00:28:02.149
on this grid paper.

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:03.909
What is the risk that somebody else in

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:06.149
the world picks the point that I picked?

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:07.909
If they pick the point that I pick, then

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.590
they will know the private and public

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.430
keys for that elliptic curve point.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.955
Therefore I'm going to be sharing my

00:28:12.956 --> 00:28:14.307
my money with this stranger

00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:15.990
somewhere else in the world.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.310
That is a possibility -- so in that sense

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.935
there is security by obscurity

00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:21.909
in cryptocurrencies -- but that is

00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:23.510
mitigated by the vast number of

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.110
addresses that are possible.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.350
And there's an even more vast number of

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.190
addresses in Monero than there are in

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.428
Bitcoin -- by 10 to the 16th.

00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:32.792
The drawback of this is that

00:28:32.793 --> 00:28:34.310
you have a less user-friendly

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.750
experience, because the

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.990
address lengths in Monero are very long

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.149
strings of numbers and letters.

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:41.669
The emission schedule is different in

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.590
Monero relative to Bitcoin.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.873
In Bitcoin, every 210,000 blocks,

00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:48.230
the miner reward that goes out to

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.549
each miner who successfully adds a block

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.685
to the network gets cut in half.

00:28:52.686 --> 00:28:53.510
If you're a Bitcoin miner,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.350
there is a date coming up sometime

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.310
in the next four years

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.389
in which your income from helping

00:28:58.399 --> 00:28:59.669
contribute to the Bitcoin

00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:01.750
ecosystem gets cut in half.  If you're

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.350
doing mining for business this is a

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.029
rather disruptive thing.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:06.870
This is something in which Monero has

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.870
looked at the granddaddy cryptocurrency,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.789
thought about what they're doing, and

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:12.149
trying something a little different that

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:13.786
might help matters a bit.

00:29:13.787 --> 00:29:15.110
And so in Monero the

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.350
emission is continually decreasing so we

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.909
are spared from this drama in Bitcoin of

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.080
having an every-four-year disruption

00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:25.269
thrown in to the mining ecosystem.

00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:26.791
There's a form of unwanted scarcity,

00:29:26.792 --> 00:29:30.026
and that is future miner rewards.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.110
In Bitcoin, the miner reward is cut in

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.839
half every four years, as I just explained.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.310
What that means is that in, say, 40 years

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.070
from now, the bitcoin reward

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.174
is going to be one-half to the 10th power,

00:29:42.175 --> 00:29:45.112
that's about 1/1000th of what it is now.

00:29:45.113 --> 00:29:46.870
This brings up a concern:  are

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.110
miners in the Bitcoin network -- in that

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.470
length of time from now -- are they going

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.149
to find that to be enough incentive to

00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:54.149
keep working for the network?  There's

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.909
some academic research that shows that

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.590
the solution that Bitcoin has come up

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.149
with -- which is to institute a fee market

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:02.230
in which the people who transact end up

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.914
engaging in a auction-like process

00:30:03.915 --> 00:30:07.278
process to bid up the fee that they offer --

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:09.510
that that idea may not be enough to

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.510
incentivize miners in the future.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.269
In Monero what we have what we call

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.630
the tail emission,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.230
that is, that the block reward is never

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.925
going to be less than 0.3 Monero per minute.

00:30:18.926 --> 00:30:21.190
Over time, the number of Monero in

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.950
existence is going to linearly

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.310
increase forever.  This gets portrayed as

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.549
being "infinite emission" by

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:30.470
people who are not thinking about it

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.310
very, I would say, fairly.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.519
The reason is that the absolute value of emission

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.750
is not relevant in any macroeconomic

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.990
theory.  Any macroeconomic theory that

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.830
takes into account what the money supply

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.350
is and the effects of changes in that

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.190
money supply in the macroeconomy

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.430
will look at the percentage increase of

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.549
that money supply.

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.549
So it's not the absolute value of U.S.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.630
dollars increasing that's relevant, it's

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.560
the percentage increase in U.S. dollars

00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:56.639
that's relevant.  And if you have

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.630
a money supply, like Monero, that is

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.950
increasing linearly over time --

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.592
every year, the money supply

00:31:02.593 --> 00:31:03.990
is going to expand by a

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.149
fixed constant amount -- which is what

00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:07.909
linear expansion just means --

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:09.590
but that's going to be added to a

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.350
pre-existing base of monero

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.749
that is going to be growing.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.549
Therefore the inflation rate

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:16.070
in percentage terms is going to be

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.990
decreasing and asymptotically going

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.310
to zero.  Which means that that is the

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.230
relevant input to any macroeconomic

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.850
theory that uses the expansion

00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:25.115
of the money supply --

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.950
an asymptotically zero

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.509
inflation rate -- and so to claim that

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:31.726
identically zero inflation rate

00:31:31.727 --> 00:31:33.577
is a totally different situation

00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:35.934
than an asymptotically zero inflation rate

00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:38.398
is silly.  It's just not factual.

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:40.870
It is easy to understand that 21 million

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.207
Bitcoin is the only amount

00:31:42.208 --> 00:31:43.430
that's ever going to be created,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.350
but it leads to a bit of a laziness of

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.110
thinking in which one comes to this

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.350
false conclusion that one must have

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.522
a identically zero inflation rate

00:31:51.523 --> 00:31:55.029
in order to be macroeconomically negligible.

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.789
What do we gain in Monero for having

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.549
this tail emission?  We know

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.470
in Monero that miner incentives are

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.990
going to be there in perpetuity.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.789
In Monero, we do not have a civil war

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.110
over who is going to be paying for miner

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.470
rewards in the future.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.230
Now this sounds like it might be trivial

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.230
and academic, but this whole position

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.149
in Bitcoin that we are going to get the

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:16.789
transactors of Bitcoin to engage in this

00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:18.789
fee market -- the viability of that was

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:20.149
debated within Bitcoin

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:21.750
and was one of the factors leading to

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.199
the divorce of Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.190
We avoid all that in Monero by having

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.509
this tail emission.

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:31.029
Here are some charts that show what I'm

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:33.029
talking about.  I'm looking at a time

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:35.430
scale of 2009, going out 15 years into

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.509
the future to the year 2035.

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:39.750
There have been about 18 million bitcoin

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.350
created and they're going to be three

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.549
million more created

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:45.750
for the rest of time.  In Monero, we also

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.110
have a predefined

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.029
schedule for what the coin emission is

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.389
going to be over time.  And so

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:52.950
to the left of August 2020, you see what

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.359
actually happened in terms of emission in the

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.950
Monero blockchain up to now,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.630
and then in the future you can see the

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.950
tail emission in Monero shows up as a

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.789
straight line that's slightly tilted up

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:04.710
to the right -- that's the tail emission in

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.310
which there's going to be a fixed number

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.779
of Monero dedicated to be given out

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.029
to miners every year, in perpetuity.

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:13.029
This differs from Bitcoin, in which they

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:14.950
have a problem to deal with, which is,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.630
how do they guarantee that the miners in

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.750
the far future are going to be

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.110
incentivized to keep

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.789
using their electricity to keep

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:22.773
supporting their network?

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.765
This is year-over-year supply inflation:

00:33:25.766 --> 00:33:27.830
how much U.S. dollars have there been

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.509
versus how much U.S. dollars have there

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:31.669
been a year ago, at the same date.

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.310
We have a scary situation with the money

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.070
supply of the U.S. dollar.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.750
As a result of the pandemic, this has

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.230
spiked up to about 30 percent.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.509
Hopefully it works out for the best,

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.190
because if it doesn't, there's going to

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.024
be a lot of suffering by humanity --

00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:48.639
but the situation is what it is.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.710
For those people looking for a source of

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.506
scarcity that is gold or gold-like --

00:33:53.507 --> 00:33:54.631
this is what you're looking at:

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:55.763
you have gold and you have

00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:57.509
new digital alternatives in the form of

00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:59.430
Bitcoin and Monero.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.750
The World Gold Council keeps track of

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.830
its estimate of how much above-ground

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.310
gold there is in the world every year,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.389
and that has been increasing at a pretty

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:11.349
constant rate about 1.8 percent per year.

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:13.296
If you use that as your litmus test,

00:34:13.297 --> 00:34:15.190
a working definition of sound money would be

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.790
a source of scarcity that

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.790
inflates by 1.8 percent per year, or less.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.190
Bitcoin and Monero both are coming up on

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.950
a new era of scarcity.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.030
The inflation rates of both Bitcoin and

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.510
Monero are going to be lower than gold,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.399
so both will satisfy that definition of sound money --

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.223
a digital form of sound money.

00:34:35.676 --> 00:34:37.190
There's another form of unwanted

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.340
scarcity that I want to talk about:

00:34:38.341 --> 00:34:40.710
that is, mining hardware.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.149
In the Bitcoin white paper there's this

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.750
phrase, "one CPU, one vote" --

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.990
and what that means is that you want to

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.990
have every miner's probability of

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.829
hitting a block reward be proportional

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:51.829
to the investment that they put in to

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.430
securing the network.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.669
Now unfortunately, silicon economies of

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.069
scale destroy this linearity.

00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:01.279
If you have an algorithm that is simple enough

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.349
that you can design a piece of silicon

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:04.550
to do nothing but

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.190
that algorithm super efficiently, then

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.109
you'll have an advantage over general

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:11.910
purpose computing devices like CPUs.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.294
In Bitcoin, you have exactly this situation.

00:35:14.295 --> 00:35:15.910
So the proof of work algorithm

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.230
in Bitcoin is simple enough that ASICs got

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.550
custom designed to do nothing but the

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.919
Bitcoin proof-of-work algorithm over and over.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.910
And unfortunately, all of the requisite

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.069
hardware happens to be all made in China,

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.670
so Bitcoin mining currently is a

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.069
Chinese-dominated oligopoly.

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:33.750
This is not necessarily a problem that

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.589
it's China;  the problem is that it's just

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:37.589
one part of the world that effectively

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.230
has a monopoly on the production of the

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.150
necessary equipment to maintain the

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.069
accounting system.

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:46.390
At this point, if you are just a regular

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.909
guy with a gaming computer

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.109
at home, and you want to

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:50.310
join that to the Bitcoin

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.390
network and try to see if you can maybe

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.390
hit a block -- you have a higher chance of

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.230
winning the lotto than getting a Bitcoin

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.670
block reward.  It's not worth your time,

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.349
it's not worth the extra electricity

00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:00.870
that your computer is going to eat while

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.550
it's trying to come up with blocks to

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.470
satisfy the Bitcoin network.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.030
So in Monero, we have taken steps to try

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:09.829
to keep the proof of work algorithm viable

00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:11.910
for small independent miners who don't

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.959
necessarily have, for example, 50 million dollars to

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.030
spend on their own silicon fabrication

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.310
facility, or have social inroads with the

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.470
CEOs of the companies who do have these

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.097
silicon fabs.  If you look at the

00:36:25.098 --> 00:36:26.470
proof of work of Monero since

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.174
2018, it has changed four times.

00:36:29.175 --> 00:36:30.870
It started out as Cryptonight, then

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.950
Cryptonight v2 came, Cryptonight v3, then

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.990
Cryptonight-R, and now RandomX.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.910
To support that narrative, this is a

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.910
chart of the Monero network difficulty,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.910
2014 to the present.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.390
So through version 0.11 of Monero, the

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.430
proof of work was

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.430
Cryptonight.  You can see that the

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.710
difficulty was

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.550
proceeding along for several years, and

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.750
then there's a spike

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.390
upwards, interpreted as ASICs coming onto

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.750
the system.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.750
There were chip manufacturers who looked

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.950
at the Monero proof of work,

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.030
figured out how to program the Monero

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.630
proof of work into a custom piece of

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.470
silicon, make that piece of silicon,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.150
plug it into the network, and then start

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.910
getting a disproportionate share of

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.190
block rewards.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.630
Once that happened, there was some alarm

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.390
in the Monero community, so work

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.150
commenced on a variant

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.390
of the Cryptonight proof of work.  So

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.510
Cryptonight v2

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.510
was developed, and tested, and then

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.870
deployed on the network.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.069
When that happened you can see the

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.310
difficulty took a nosedive, because all

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.150
these ASICs that were previously

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.910
viable and collecting a lot of the block

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.510
reward were now shut out, because the

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.910
proof of work changed on them.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.349
Several months later, there was another

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:34.950
upward spike in the difficulty --

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.630
there's a several month lead time from

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.069
the time that you design an

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:39.589
ASIC to the time that you actually

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:41.670
fabricate it in enough quantity to make a

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.030
big dent on the network --

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.270
so that was ASICs coming back online.  So

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.109
Cryptonight was patched again.

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:49.349
So again there was another hard fork in

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:51.750
late 2018 to change to Cryptonight v3.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.670
That worked for another few months.  Then

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.589
the difficulty spiked up again.

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.190
And then there was Cryptonight-R --

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.109
mercifully, there was this silence from

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.790
the ASIC manufacturer.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.150
And then finally, there was a

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.150
revolutionary change in the

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.670
proof-of-work algorithm to RandomX

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.829
which uses a randomly generated

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:10.390
algorithm that must be executed in order

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.750
to do the proof of work.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.910
It uses not only integer operations but

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.589
even floating point operations, and so

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:16.710
it's a very interesting

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.037
example of a proof-of-work algorithm --

00:38:19.038 --> 00:38:20.310
for which

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.870
the customized piece of silicon that

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.710
will do RandomX the best

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.349
happens to be an AMD Ryzen Threadripper,

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:29.598
which is something that you can buy on Amazon.

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:32.230
Commodity hardware is the most efficient

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.230
at doing the Monero proof of work.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.470
These ASIC manufacturers do not have the

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.630
most honest reputation, shall we say, of

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.230
immediately shipping their product out

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.069
once a customer buys an ASIC.

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:44.310
There tends to be a several month lag

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.230
due to, you know, "testing" --

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.150
and why would a ASIC manufacturer want

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.479
to delay shipment of product that's been paid for?

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.310
Well, they want to collect Bitcoin block

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.990
rewards with their customers' hardware

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.349
before they send it out.

00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:57.030
So that's the shenanigans that one has

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.790
to deal with when one does not have

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.190
a commodity piece of hardware to do

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.109
proof of work.

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:05.589
Since RandomX has gone into effect, what

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:07.349
is meant by a hash

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:09.589
now is different in RandomX versus

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:11.030
Cryptonight, so there's a

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.270
one-time jump in the difficulty which is

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.190
meaningless -- but since RandomX went in,

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.238
all signs have been that CPUs have,

00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:20.159
once again, been dominating the network.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.790
There's been an enormous level of effort

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.910
that's gone into this.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.340
This is remarkable for any cryptocurrency.

00:39:26.341 --> 00:39:28.069
It's a testament to the

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:30.470
persistence, and really, the unanimity of

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.630
the Monero community in having this goal

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.750
of something that's actually

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.190
decentralized in practice,

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.510
with small independent miners having a

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.312
shot at getting a block reward in Monero.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.950
Another form of unwanted scarcity is

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.310
access to layer one.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.990
Bitcoin's one megabyte block limit

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.750
caused a project fork.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.829
There is a controversy as to whether

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:51.910
this line of code which Satoshi had put

00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:53.317
into the Bitcoin client,

00:39:53.318 --> 00:39:55.270
saying that blocks have to be no

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.030
larger than one megabyte in size,

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.030
which is something that Satoshi did as a

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.190
kludgy way of preventing the network

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.190
from getting spammed.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.030
The idea that there's going to be a hard

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.630
block limit that doesn't change has

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.104
survived in Bitcoin -- at least, in the dominant

00:40:09.105 --> 00:40:11.439
post-divorce implementation of Bitcoin.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.510
I'm showing a exponential scale, so this

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.270
is 10 transactions a day on the bottom

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.519
to a million transactions a day on the top.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.870
In Bitcoin you can see that the

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.630
transactions per day in Bitcoin have

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.150
asymptotically hit a ceiling, and that is

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.630
due to this one megabyte block limit.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.069
Again in Monero, we look at what's

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:27.589
happening in the granddaddy

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:28.550
cryptocurrency,

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.790
and give it all due respect as the first

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.069
to exist -- but we're

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:33.990
looking at what could be done as an

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.750
alternative solution to some of these

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.309
issues.  And so in Monero, we use what is

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:39.910
called an adaptive block weight --

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.349
it used to be called the adaptive block

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:42.950
size but there were modifications to the

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.069
algorithm so now it's called the

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.430
adaptive block weight --

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.349
the basic idea is that there is no

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:50.479
hard-coded limit on the size of a Monero block.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.390
There is a miner disincentive that kicks

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.030
in when blocks get too big -- so that

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.309
disincentivizes miners from including

00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:59.358
a whole bunch of transactions into a block.

00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:01.190
There are user fees that also increase

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.190
if the blocks get too big.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.990
The size can dynamically expand if there

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.430
is organic growth

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.990
in the demand for Monero transactions.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.049
From this past history

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.309
of transactions per day, you

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:13.990
can make a pretty good argument that the

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.750
trend line of this, transactions per day,

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.270
is on the way up.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.349
It's unlikely to be spam related -- it's

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:21.519
unlikely that spammers are just carefully

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.030
spamming the network by just a little

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.950
bit and then increasing the amount of

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.030
spam that they send over time --

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.030
this seems to be organic growth in the

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.030
demand for Monero transactions.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.750
[From] 2016 to this time today, that's a

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.910
10x increase in the transactions per day.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.589
It doesn't look like much on this chart,

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:39.270
but that is quite significant.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.630
In four years, at this pace, we're going

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.309
to be looking at a hundred thousand

00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:43.109
transactions per day,

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:44.950
and then in the year 2028, maybe in

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.990
DEF CON we'll be showing a million

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.790
transactions a day, who knows.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.230
At this point of the talk I want to talk

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.069
about fungibility and transparency -- and

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.270
this is where the two

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.870
"mission statements" of these two

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.950
cryptocurrency projects start to diverge

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.710
quite strongly.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.337
Bitcoin is transparent.

00:42:00.338 --> 00:42:02.150
Etched forever for everyone to see,

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.230
is for every transaction, you can see the

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.150
sender the receiver and the amount;

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.829
for every address, you can see a complete

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:09.510
live balance history.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.670
This is contrary to what you might have

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.430
heard from the popular press, if you're

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.670
new to getting into the real details of

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.589
cryptocurrency, because the news reports

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.990
always make Bitcoin out to be this anonymous

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.159
currency that nobody knows anything about.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.829
Nothing could be further from the truth --

00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:25.910
it's actually completely transparent.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.750
For high-net-worth clients that I work

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.190
with in my consulting practice,

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.707
this tends to be a show stopper,

00:42:30.708 --> 00:42:32.230
once they know about it --

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.630
once they become aware of this fact, that

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.879
if you put a million dollars into Bitcoin,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.550
as soon as they know your Bitcoin

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.309
address, anyone in the world

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:42.150
can go to their blockchain explorer, type

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.990
in that address and see there's 100

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.298
bitcoin in there, that's worth a lot of money.

00:42:46.299 --> 00:42:47.999
No one with wealth wants to

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.406
broadcast that to the world --

00:42:49.407 --> 00:42:52.059
it's just indiscreet, and it's unsafe.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.639
So the fact that there's this transparency

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.270
in Bitcoin puts innocent people at risk.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.550
Also, businesses -- because

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.470
businesses have, as part of their secret

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.750
sauce as to how they

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.557
are able to serve humanity and

00:43:03.558 --> 00:43:05.270
make a profit at the same time --

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.030
is that they have a certain pattern of

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.030
suppliers they get their inputs from.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.030
So often times, the prices of those

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.030
products might not be public knowledge.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.309
There are lots of trade secrets that

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:17.199
businesses have and there's no shame in that --

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.349
for some reason, for some people, any sort

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:21.589
of desire for privacy gets portrayed as

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.670
being something nefarious.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.750
Businesses routinely need privacy in

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.750
order to survive as businesses, in order

00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:29.750
for their intellectual property, their trade

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.270
secrets, to not be copied by competitors.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.559
Another problem in Bitcoin that goes beyond

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.670
privacy is fungibility.  Every coin in the

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.159
Bitcoin network is traceable back to the miner.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.150
So it's as if you have a $10 bill

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.620
and on the back of the $10 bill

00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:47.430
there's a neat chart that shows

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.270
your bank account numbers, and the

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.230
account numbers of everyone

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.710
before you who had that $10 bill

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.470
going all the way back to the U.S.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.510
Mint that fabricated the $10 bill.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.190
It's even worse than that, because if it

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.550
were actually on a physical piece of paper

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.069
then the holder of the piece of paper

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:03.430
would be the only one who could see it.

00:44:03.431 --> 00:44:05.510
In Bitcoin, everyone in the world can see that

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.270
transaction list for every piece of

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.670
currency that's in the entire system.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.133
That invites voyeurism.

00:44:11.134 --> 00:44:12.870
If you know a Bitcoin address

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.190
it's natural to go to a Bitcoin explorer

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.550
and type in the address and see how much

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.670
money is there and see how many

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.950
transactions they do.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.030
I think it's a pernicious social effect

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.870
of this feature of the protocol --

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.292
it's normalized being nosy.

00:44:25.293 --> 00:44:27.109
There's also guilt by association,

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:29.190
and this is far more serious.  There are

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.759
many companies in existence whose job it is

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.670
to try and associate names and faces

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.078
with every address in Bitcoin.  They're trying to

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.390
dox everyone on the Bitcoin network.  And

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.910
what do they do with that information?

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.589
They basically come up with the

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:43.750
equivalent of a social credit score.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.199
Because every bitcoin in existence can be traced,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.230
they can make a graph showing people

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.230
transacting money with each other, and if

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.664
any of these people happen to be a

00:44:53.665 --> 00:44:55.030
"bad" person,

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.030
then those people who happen to have

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.870
exchanged money with that bad person are

00:44:58.871 --> 00:45:00.870
now flagged as potentially being bad

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.030
themselves.  The problem with this

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.950
is that it's based on imperfect

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.950
information that is easy to misinterpret.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.344
In contrast, Monero is fungible.

00:45:11.345 --> 00:45:13.560
Every Monero is indistinguishable

00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:15.358
from every other Monero.

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:16.630
There are three technologies that

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.147
promote this indistinguishability.

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.829
One is ring signatures,

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:22.230
those keep transacting senders private;

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.430
stealth addresses keep

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.993
transacting receivers private; and RingCT

00:45:25.994 --> 00:45:28.879
keeps transaction amounts sent private.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.349
When a person joins the Monero network

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:32.608
by downloading the software

00:45:32.609 --> 00:45:34.309
at getmonero.org, and

00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:35.750
running that on their computer, and

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.589
downloading a copy of the blockchain

00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:39.270
from their peer miners,

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.270
then they are getting a complete history

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.950
of who sent what to who in Monero.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.630
The difference is:  in Monero it's all

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.069
encrypted, because

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:48.470
by default, it's none of your business.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.630
You will know that transactions happened;

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.230
you will know when they happened, and you

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.670
will know that they happened, but you

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.839
won't see the details of what happened.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.990
Two of these three technologies were

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.750
included in the original whitepaper

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.937
that defined Monero -- which is the

00:46:02.938 --> 00:46:04.309
Cryptonote whitepaper --

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.550
but RingCT was not.  RingCT was a

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.069
innovation.  And the

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:09.750
history of how this got into the network

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.150
is an example of the dedication of this

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.790
group of people to put it in.  RingCT

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.550
required several ingredients to come to

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.990
fruition:  first it required

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.150
original cryptographic research -- we're

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.910
talking postdoc, PhD

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.990
mathematician level cryptographic

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.829
research -- that goes through audit and

00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:26.870
peer review.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.510
Second, you need development of code to

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.030
implement this new math.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.030
The math is not trivial, and then to

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.950
write code that faithfully implements

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.270
that new math is also not trivial --

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.270
just in case there were problems in the

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.390
code that got written, it got

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.870
subject to external audit, so basically

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.309
the Monero community was

00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:47.109
solicited for donations to pay for

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:49.919
external auditors to examine the code of RingCT

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.670
and make sure that there were no subtle

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.150
errors of memory overwrites or such,

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.030
and that got approved.  Then finally, it

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.790
doesn't matter if code gets written if

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.069
nobody actually runs it.

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:02.870
So the community of Monero node owners

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.300
needed to get on board

00:47:04.301 --> 00:47:05.349
and download this and

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.109
update their computers once the new code

00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:09.589
came out, because this was a hard fork.

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:11.109
So all these ingredients had to happen

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.996
for RingCT to go in.

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:15.349
On the top I'm showing daily average

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.870
bytes per transaction on both the

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.790
Bitcoin network and the Monero network.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.870
Bitcoin is in black, and it's been pretty

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.150
constant over time.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.670
That's part of their community ethos

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.418
over at Bitcoin, is that they want a stable

00:47:25.419 --> 00:47:27.679
protocol, they don't want to rock the boat.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.910
In Monero, we are used to acknowledging

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.190
that they're going to be new research,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.589
new innovations that make fungibility

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.863
even better -- and we go through

00:47:35.864 --> 00:47:37.270
the time and the trouble and the effort

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.988
to actually make that happen.

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:41.190
In the birth days of Monero, you

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.349
see that the transaction size in bytes

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:44.950
was very small, because those were mostly

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.870
coinbase transactions going out to

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.670
empty blocks.  But then people started

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.270
using it, and then in the early days of

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.870
Monero the system used

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.349
denominated outputs.  You can think of

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:58.307
there being like a one-Monero gold chunk

00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:01.305
that is encased in plastic and it's engraved

00:48:01.306 --> 00:48:04.159
with the owner's key information on it.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.230
Once a person spends that one-Monero

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.470
output, then it transmits, and it becomes

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.990
the property of somebody else on the

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.190
Monero network.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.950
And so, in the early days of Monero, you

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.870
had every round number -- so you had

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.390
1 through 9, 10 through 90,

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.858
100 through 900 -- and then going the other way:

00:48:18.859 --> 00:48:22.549
0.1 through 0.9, 0.01 through 0.09...

00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:24.069
and so as a result there were a large

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.750
number of inputs and a large number of

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.510
outputs on every transaction.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.390
This was not so good for privacy, because

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.634
if you spend 341 Monero,

00:48:32.635 --> 00:48:33.990
just to make up a number, you

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.309
can see the 300 and the 40 and the 1,

00:48:36.319 --> 00:48:37.990
you can see they're travelling around --

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.670
that's what you could see in Monero

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.430
pre-RingCT.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.270
And so, it was decided in the community

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.030
that this was not acceptable, and so when

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.710
the research for RingCT

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.549
was tested and vetted and also

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:49.990
externally audited

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.430
there was a decision in the community to

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.829
do it.  Now, this was despite the fact that

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:55.910
when RingCT was enabled, you can see

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.262
there's this big jump in 2017

00:48:58.263 --> 00:49:00.399
of the transaction size, so it went to about

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.235
10 kilobytes per transaction.

00:49:02.236 --> 00:49:04.743
But that was a price that was decided in

00:49:04.744 --> 00:49:06.879
the Monero community was worth it

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.998
to improve fungibility of the coin --

00:49:08.999 --> 00:49:11.490
which would protect the innocent.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.810
Then later, bulletproofs came --

00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:15.349
more clever mathematics

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:19.118
to ensure that the balance of inputs and outputs,

00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:22.479
that is guaranteed using higher math in RingCT,

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.470
can be done with far less byte space

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.549
than it previously did.

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:28.390
There's a research process, an audit

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.470
process, a coding process, and a vetting

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.424
process for all this for bulletproofs as well.

00:49:32.425 --> 00:49:33.990
But when that went live on the network --

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.910
that was in late 2018 -- you can see that

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.750
the transaction size dropped by

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.829
basically an order of magnitude.

00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:40.870
And then you can see here on the

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.270
transaction fee side, the fees also dropped

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.510
by an order of magnitude.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.950
You could argue that the Monero

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.549
transaction sizes are still quite a bit

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:50.069
larger than Bitcoin's,

00:49:50.079 --> 00:49:52.230
but there's a new news item in the

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.069
Monero research pipeline --

00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:57.430
CLSAGs are a way to compress the

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.190
byte size requirement of transactions

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.487
even further, on top of what

00:50:00.488 --> 00:50:01.829
bulletproofs have done --

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:03.589
that just went through an audit process

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:05.270
and it's being coded up for

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.670
inclusion in the next hard fork.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.750
In Monero, "hard fork" is not a term of

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.589
war;  it's something we look forward to

00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:13.190
because it means that new good stuff is

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.870
going to come on live.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.950
So CLSAGs are set to go live on the

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.309
network this October,

00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.470
and once that happens, I'm showing in a

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.430
dotted line here

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.190
the magnitude of improvement that we're

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.349
expecting to see post-CLSAG.

00:50:25.359 --> 00:50:27.190
There's a gap here between the

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.630
transaction sizes between Monero and

00:50:28.631 --> 00:50:31.109
Bitcoin, but it's shrinking.  The reason it's

00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:33.270
shrinking is that there is ongoing

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.430
active research in Monero to improve

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.430
the way the engine works under the hood.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.190
This is the kind of thing that is

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.059
actually rare to see in other cryptocurrencies.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.639
Other cryptocurrencies tend to

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.309
make big announcements, use lots of

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:45.670
buzzwords, and not

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.750
actually improve anything.  It's actually

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.030
the opposite in Monero --

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.829
people work quietly without fanfare, and

00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:53.393
from time to time, introduce something

00:50:53.394 --> 00:50:56.284
that improves the actual product.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.663
Monero benefits people with nothing to hide.

00:51:00.664 --> 00:51:02.799
It does that by eliminating the risk

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.796
of receiving coins that are tainted,

00:51:04.797 --> 00:51:06.790
due to no fault of the receiver.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.843
So for example --

00:51:07.844 --> 00:51:10.069
let's say you're selling your used car,

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:11.990
and the person who you sell your car to

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.190
gives you bitcoin.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.308
And, like everyone else who sells their car

00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:17.759
to a stranger by posting an ad on Craigslist,

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.190
you didn't do a thorough background

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.109
check on this person who bought your car.

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.630
They had bitcoin, you had a car, you did

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.470
an exchange, you went on your way.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.470
Unbeknownst to you, the way that they got

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.052
their bitcoin was that they were,

00:51:28.053 --> 00:51:30.069
for example, selling drugs on the dark web --

00:51:30.079 --> 00:51:31.349
and that's how they came up with that

00:51:31.359 --> 00:51:33.349
bitcoin, which now you own, because you

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.270
sold your car to this person.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.270
And now, because the companies that are

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.510
doing blockchain analysis know that --

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.990
now they are looking at you, thinking,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.990
"this person just got ten thousand dollars

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.270
worth of bitcoin from

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.390
a known drug dealer... maybe this person is

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.150
supplying drug paraphernalia

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.030
to that dealer."  Now this person tries to

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.109
put their tainted bitcoin into a crypto

00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:57.589
exchange to get USD out of it.

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.430
Once they send their tainted bitcoin to

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.030
their exchange, it gets frozen,

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.790
and now the customer has to go through

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.529
all sorts of extra hoops to prove their innocence.

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.109
And they're trying to prove their

00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:08.710
innocence to somebody who really doesn't

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.390
care to know the truth --

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.910
they just want to cover liability on

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.270
their side, they just want to make sure

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.630
that they don't get in trouble.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.150
The easiest thing to do is just to

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.829
quarantine that money, not give it back

00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:19.270
to the customer, and wait for

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.790
the authorities to give them permission

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.109
to give it back.  And none of this had

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:24.790
anything to do with the innocent person

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.069
involved.  This is why the transparency of

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:29.349
Bitcoin is a problem --

00:52:29.359 --> 00:52:31.510
even for innocent people who have

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.790
nothing to hide.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.270
Because the system is transparent, false

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.270
accusations can be made against them

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.150
due to incomplete misunderstandings that

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.910
other third parties are making

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.300
based on that transaction data.

00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:46.069
It's even worse than that.  So, for example,

00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:48.069
let's say you're an owner of Bitcoin,

00:52:48.079 --> 00:52:49.990
you're totally 100 percent squeaky clean,

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.118
and you get hacked.  Somebody steals your bitcoin.

00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:54.870
Let's say that the person who stole your

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.390
bitcoin now goes

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.148
on the dark web and spends it.

00:52:58.149 --> 00:52:59.670
Now your address,

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.069
your identity, is associated with that.

00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:04.479
You might be investigated for crimes that were

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.390
committed with your bitcoin that got

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.230
stolen.  And so, now,

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.750
not only are you suffering the loss of

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.349
your money, you're having to now

00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:13.750
explain that "it's not the case that I

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.589
paid this guy to buy drugs for me,

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:18.470
I actually had my money stolen from me!"

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.192
For people who actually are

00:53:20.193 --> 00:53:22.390
squeaky clean, any involvement

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.790
in the Bitcoin blockchain means you have

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.150
a probability of

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.069
interacting with somebody else on the

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:29.589
Bitcoin blockchain who is not as

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:30.950
squeaky clean as you are.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.950
And if that happens, that's going to be

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.790
flagged in these companies

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.270
doing blockchain analysis as a link, when

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.591
the fact is, it's a false positive.

00:53:39.592 --> 00:53:41.943
But you as the user have no power over that.

00:53:41.944 --> 00:53:43.510
You have no recourse;  you have no way of

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.109
communicating to these companies and saying

00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:47.430
"hey, yo, I'm actually squeaky clean."

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.480
They don't know.  They don't care.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.670
One way to look at this is in the Akerloff

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.510
framework.  So this was a Nobel Prize

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.722
winning paper in economics;

00:53:56.723 --> 00:53:58.230
it has to do with used cars.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.910
So first, I'll explain the paper, and then

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.430
I'll apply it, because it has

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.870
applications to both DEF CON

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.470
"Safe Mode," our virtual meeting that we're

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.230
doing -- and also a surveillance state with

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.589
transparent coins.

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:08.870
So there are two used car types:  there

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.790
are lemons and there are peaches.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.990
Lemons are the cars that are going to

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.710
break right away, and peaches are the

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.270
well-maintained used cars.  So sellers

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.950
know which type of car they have --

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.870
if you own a lemon, you know it, because

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.309
you were there in the hurricane when

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:23.270
your car was under

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.030
five feet of water and now you're trying

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.470
to sell your car because it's damaged,

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.270
that's a lemon --

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.109
a peach is a car with the type of owner

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:30.790
who changes the oil and does all the

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.150
maintenance that you have to do on a car

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.910
to keep it in good condition.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.510
So the sellers know what kind of car

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.109
they have, but the buyers don't,

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:38.789
because both lemon sellers and peach

00:54:38.799 --> 00:54:40.470
sellers make sure that the paint job on

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.154
their car is extra shiny.

00:54:42.155 --> 00:54:43.670
On a superficial level,

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.270
both lemons and peaches look identical

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.109
to buyers.  So the buyers can't tell

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:48.870
lemons apart from peaches, but they know

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.470
that they are ignorant in this situation --

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.879
they know that they could end up with a lemon.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.870
The Akerloff paper brilliantly

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.470
explains this race to the bottom that

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.390
happens in this asymmetric information

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.309
market in which buyers are armed with

00:55:00.319 --> 00:55:02.789
less information than the sellers are.

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.870
What is the offer price that a buyer is

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.309
going to offer for a car?

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:07.349
At the minimum, you're going to be

00:55:07.359 --> 00:55:09.430
offering the lemon price -- and then you're

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.190
going to offer more than the lemon price

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.999
contingent on what you think the probability is

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.318
that you're going to get a peach versus a lemon.

00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:17.829
So if you think there's a zero percent

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.109
chance you're going to get a peach -- well

00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:19.990
you're just going to offer

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.309
the lemon price.  If you think there's 100

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.750
percent chance that you're going to get a

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.670
peach, then you're going to offer the

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.950
lemon price plus the

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.390
difference between the peach and the

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.670
lemon price.  In other words, you'll offer

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.710
the peach price.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.910
If you think the probability is

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.190
somewhere in between -- then you're going

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.309
to adjust your offer price to be

00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:35.750
somewhere in between.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.589
That's the offer price that a rational

00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:39.349
buyer is going to offer for a car in

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.950
this market, in which they are ignorant,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.309
but they know that they're ignorant, and

00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:44.230
they can adjust their offer price to

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.193
account for this uncertainty.

00:55:46.194 --> 00:55:47.887
So what do the lemon sellers do

00:55:47.888 --> 00:55:49.838
when they see this price?  Well, they see

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:51.910
a great offer -- this sucker here is

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.670
offering quite a bit higher price than

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.470
the lemon price.

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.230
So the lemon seller is delighted -- they're

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.606
going to say, "Okay, I thought about it and

00:55:58.607 --> 00:56:01.199
yeah, I guess I'll accept your offer."

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:01.990
The peach seller --

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.409
they've done the maintenance on their car,

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:04.905
they know that the value of their car is

00:56:04.906 --> 00:56:06.155
worth what a peach is --

00:56:06.156 --> 00:56:07.771
but you can tell them all day

00:56:07.772 --> 00:56:08.950
that you've done a great job of

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.470
maintaining your car, but the buyer,

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.670
at the end of the day, they're going to

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.870
be skeptical.  They don't know if you're

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.990
really telling them the truth.  They don't

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.159
know if you're telling them the partial truth.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.069
So the price that the buyer is going to

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:20.318
offer is less than that of the peach price.

00:56:20.319 --> 00:56:21.260
And so what's going to happen then?

00:56:21.261 --> 00:56:22.658
The peach sellers are going to

00:56:22.659 --> 00:56:23.750
become discouraged.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.510
They're going to be disappointed by the

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.960
fact that their moral goodness

00:56:26.961 --> 00:56:28.230
in taking care of their car

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.829
is not going to be reflected in a high

00:56:29.839 --> 00:56:30.660
market price.

00:56:30.661 --> 00:56:31.706
So they will leave the market --

00:56:31.707 --> 00:56:33.660
they will delete their Craigslist ad --

00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:34.870
they will just keep their car

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.554
until it runs into the ground.

00:56:36.555 --> 00:56:39.109
Now, a greater fraction of the cars

00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:40.150
that are available for sale

00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:41.322
are now lemons.

00:56:41.323 --> 00:56:43.039
And eventually, buyers are

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.523
going to get wise to that fact.

00:56:44.524 --> 00:56:45.750
When they get wise to that fact,

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.349
they're going to lower further

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:48.430
their offer price --

00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:49.835
and thus, the negative

00:56:49.836 --> 00:56:51.349
feedback loop is born.

00:56:51.359 --> 00:56:53.510
Every time the offer price goes down,

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.710
more peach sellers are going to get

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.230
discouraged and leave the market.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.069
You have a situation at the end where

00:56:58.079 --> 00:57:00.687
only lemons exist in this car market.

00:57:00.688 --> 00:57:01.510
So this was the

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.190
Akerloff paper that got the Nobel Prize.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.394
Let's think about this in terms of the pandemic.

00:57:05.395 --> 00:57:06.549
In health terms,

00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:08.184
peaches are people who are healthy.

00:57:08.185 --> 00:57:09.670
And they are now

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.984
faced with the decision of:

00:57:10.985 --> 00:57:12.870
"do I engage in this

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.430
super thing called DEF CON, in which a

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.030
whole bunch of smart people get together,

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.950
and talk about cool geeky stuff,

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.270
and you make new geeky friends in Vegas

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.630
and have fun" --

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.390
basically, are you going to engage in

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.710
this social marketplace in which you are

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.418
dealing with other people?

00:57:28.419 --> 00:57:29.589
You could be dealing with

00:57:29.599 --> 00:57:31.122
all peaches when you get to the

00:57:31.123 --> 00:57:32.470
live, in-person DEF CON --

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.030
that is, everyone could be healthy -- but

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:35.990
you are aware that

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.898
that's not the case.

00:57:36.899 --> 00:57:37.764
There are going to be some lemons.

00:57:37.765 --> 00:57:38.906
There are going to be some people

00:57:38.907 --> 00:57:40.843
who are sick, and don't know it,

00:57:40.844 --> 00:57:42.549
because of the nature of the virus.

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.910
So you have to gauge your overall social

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.510
utility of going to the conference

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.950
by the probability that you're going to

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.109
end up with a lemon -- i.e., get sick.

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:52.950
If the penalty function of getting a

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.150
lemon is large enough,

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.750
and the probability of it is large

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.190
enough, then the rational thing to do

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.430
is to withdraw from that marketplace and

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.349
decide to do DEF CON in "safe mode,"

00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:03.573
and that's exactly what we've done this year.

00:58:04.292 --> 00:58:05.670
Let's apply this to the marketplace

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.851
for transparent coins,

00:58:06.852 --> 00:58:09.430
or surveillance coins, as I like to call them.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.190
The complete history of every coin is

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.030
traceable going back.  That means,

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.030
if you are a squeaky clean person with a

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.150
good reputation,

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.531
you are a peach seller.

00:58:17.734 --> 00:58:20.470
Your social status is healthy.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.069
The thing is, if you deal with bitcoin

00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:23.510
with other people, are you going to

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.950
unknowingly, by mistake,

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.950
do a transaction with somebody who is

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.707
not healthy, in terms of a legal status?

00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:31.057
You don't know that.

00:58:31.058 --> 00:58:32.309
You could suffer

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:34.470
a "lemon consequence," just by dealing with

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.390
other people in this network, because

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.910
this network has this

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.278
undesirable feature that the

00:58:39.279 --> 00:58:40.723
coins are not fungible.

00:58:40.724 --> 00:58:41.919
So what is a squeaky clean

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.030
person going to do?

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:46.078
They're going to tend to want to go to a coin

00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.805
that does not put them in jeopardy

00:58:47.806 --> 00:58:49.990
due to the actions that they can't control

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.531
of other people on the network.

00:58:51.532 --> 00:58:52.233
So you're going to see

00:58:52.234 --> 00:58:53.190
the squeaky clean people

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.549
going to something like Monero.

00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:56.789
Which is counterintuitive, certainly,

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:57.990
according to the

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.069
biased and misleading portrayal that

00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:01.829
often gets put on Monero.

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:02.939
It's the squeaky clean people

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.526
who need Monero the most.

00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:08.361
So Monero is what Bitcoin noobs think they bought --

00:59:08.362 --> 00:59:11.956
it's sound money, in safe mode.

00:59:13.119 --> 00:59:15.349
I started this talk talking about the

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:16.150
out of control

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.069
fiat money supply around the world that

00:59:18.079 --> 00:59:19.349
is currently happening as a result of

00:59:19.359 --> 00:59:20.309
the pandemic,

00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:21.694
and that led to the

00:59:21.695 --> 00:59:23.439
idea that one should maybe

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.349
spend some time looking into alternate

00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:26.630
forms of scarcity that are not

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.990
controlled by governments -- that would be

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.414
precious metals and also,

00:59:29.415 --> 00:59:31.289
now that there's Nakamoto consensus,

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:33.328
Bitcoin and Monero.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.390
How does one process the relative

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.720
expensiveness or cheapness

00:59:37.721 --> 00:59:39.657
of these assets?

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.390
Here is, I think, the only price chart

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.872
that should be looked at

00:59:43.873 --> 00:59:45.270
by anyone who's looking to

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.270
think of cryptocurrency as an investment.

00:59:47.289 --> 00:59:49.006
I'm doing a long-term time scale --

00:59:49.007 --> 00:59:51.510
so this is from 2009 to the present,

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.030
and what I'm doing here is I'm showing

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.109
the value of all the world's bitcoin

00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:56.870
and I'm dividing that by the value of

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.549
all the world's above-ground gold.

00:59:58.559 --> 01:00:00.029
So there are several variables

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.099
that go into this chart:

01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:02.514
first, there's the number of bitcoin

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:04.069
in existence at any given time;

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:05.750
there's the price of bitcoin; there's

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.589
the amount of gold in existence at any

01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:09.349
given time; and there's the price of gold.

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:10.710
You need all four of those ingredients

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.069
to come up with this ratio chart, which

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:14.150
I'm showing on log scale, again.  And then

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.589
I've done that again for the value of

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:17.030
all the world's Monero divided by the

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.470
value of all the world's gold.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.990
Currently all the world's bitcoin is

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.829
worth something like two percent that of

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:22.950
all the world's gold.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.190
And all the Monero in the world is worth

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.270
about 1/100th of one percent

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.789
of all the world's gold.

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.309
You might be aware that there's been a

01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:31.589
recent spike of interest in

01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:32.710
cryptocurrency prices --

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.849
bitcoin is back over ten thousand dollars --

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:36.069
but you don't see that here

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:38.150
because there's also been a spike in the

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.470
price of gold.  The relative valuation of

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.990
crypto to gold has been flat

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.390
in the post-pandemic time period.  Is this

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.710
rational that crypto to gold cap ratios

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.446
have been flat during the pandemic?

01:00:48.447 --> 01:00:50.141
I'll leave that to you to decide.

01:00:50.142 --> 01:00:52.390
Second, of these two cryptocurrencies,

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.219
there is one that actually acts like gold,

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.349
because it's fungible.

01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:57.589
Gold does not have on the back of every

01:00:57.599 --> 01:00:59.589
gold bar, a list of everyone who owned

01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:01.270
that gold before you did.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.349
So it's actually a more apt comparison

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.759
to compare the value of Monero versus gold.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.377
So is it rational that

01:01:07.378 --> 01:01:09.190
the valuation of Monero is one

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.710
ten-thousandth of that of gold, whereas

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.710
the valuation of bitcoin is one fiftieth

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.549
of that of gold?

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.390
One thing I also wanted to show was a

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.630
chart that counters this very stale

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.910
narrative that there's infinite

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.670
inflation in Monero.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.670
Let's say you have an investor who

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.109
decides that they want to buy

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:27.349
one one-millionth of one of these

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:29.990
alternative forms of scarcity.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.069
To protect themselves against inflation,

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:33.589
they are not going to buy one

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:35.716
one-millionth of today's supply;

01:01:35.717 --> 01:01:37.550
they are going to buy one one-millionth

01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:40.479
of the supply in 100 years' time.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.309
So they're going to look at:  "what is the

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:44.870
supply of this scarce asset going to be

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.990
in the year 2120 -- and I would like to buy

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.230
one one-millionth of that, today."

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.910
First, let's look at gold.  So currently,

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.654
there are about 200,000 metric tons of

01:01:53.655 --> 01:01:55.029
above-ground gold,

01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:56.857
and gold has been expanding

01:01:56.858 --> 01:01:59.200
at about 1.8 percent per year.

01:01:59.201 --> 01:02:00.789
When you compound that over

01:02:00.799 --> 01:02:02.069
a hundred years, that ends up being pretty

01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:04.309
significant.  So in 2120, at that rate,

01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:05.190
there's going to be over a million

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.390
metric tons of gold --

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.470
which means to buy one one-millionth of

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.589
all the gold in the world, you're going

01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:11.270
to end up buying more than a metric ton

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.789
of it -- which, at the current price, is

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:15.118
going to be $76 million worth of gold.

01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:17.750
That buys you one one-millionth of the

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.549
projected gold supply in the year 2120.

01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:21.990
So let's do that with Bitcoin.  So with

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.829
Bitcoin, they're going to be very proud

01:02:23.839 --> 01:02:25.589
that a hundred years from today, there's

01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:27.510
going to be only 21 million bitcoin

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.910
in existence.  To buy one one-millionth,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.935
how much does it cost?

01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:32.936
244 thousand dollars.

01:02:33.196 --> 01:02:34.239
How about in Monero?

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.910
Now we have the tail emission, so that

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.510
commonly gets thrown about as being

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.190
"infinite inflation."  Well, actually,

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.230
we know what it's going to be.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.622
And in a hundred years from now,

01:02:41.623 --> 01:02:43.670
the coin supply will be less than double

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.703
what it is today.

01:02:44.704 --> 01:02:46.870
That's not too bad for a century.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.789
So to buy one one-millionth of all the

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.710
Monero that will be in the world in the

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.680
year 2120?  Three thousand dollars.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.150
If you want to learn more about Monero --

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.230
there's monerovillage.org for the

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.549
rest of the festivities happening this week.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:06.080
Also, the official website

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:07.464
is getmonero.org --

01:03:07.465 --> 01:03:08.526
that's important to know, it's

01:03:08.527 --> 01:03:09.919
"get monero dot org" --

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.308
not other variants.

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:12.499
If you want to get in touch with me over

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.558
email, it's Daniel at Sweetwater dot Consulting.

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:15.968
Thanks for your attention.
