Some antiviruses may erroneously consider the miner as dangerous software.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. Make sure the software you downloaded is legitimate\n2. Add an exception for it in your antivirus, so that it won't get removed or blocked"

          "title": "What is a tail emission and why is it needed?",
          "content": "Tail emission is a constant block reward that never goes to zero. It avoids a future where miners rely only on fees and are tempted to favor large, visible payers or censor small users. A small, permanent reward helps keep security honest and decentralized."

          "title": "Does tail emission = endless inflation?",
