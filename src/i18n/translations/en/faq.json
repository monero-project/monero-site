            "title": "What is Monero?",
            "content": "Monero is uncompromising digital cash. You can pay and get paid without turning your financial life into a public record, while the network still enforces the rules for everyone."

        "isMoneroMixer": {
            "title": "Is Monero a mixer?",
            "content": "No. Mixers take your coins, hold them, then try to hide the trail.\n\nMonero never takes custody of your money. Privacy is built into the protocol itself for every transaction, all the time."

        "doesMoneroUseEncryption": {
            "title": "Does Monero use encryption?",
            "content": "Yes. Monero uses strong public key encryption and zero knowledge proofs so that transaction data is never published in plain form.\n\nOn chain you only see encrypted commitments and proofs that the rules are followed, instead of a readable payment history."
        },
        "isMoneroLegal": {
            "title": "Is Monero legal to use?",
            "content": "In most places, using privacy tools is legal. Monero is a neutral asset, like VPNs, locks on doors or encrypted messages. Businesses and individuals should follow their local laws, but privacy itself is not a crime."
        },
        "isMoneroForCriminals": {
            "title": "Is Monero for criminals?",
            "content": "Monero is for everyone. It is used by ordinary people and businesses who do not want their salaries, savings, donations or purchases permanently exposed on a public ledger.\n\nBad actors abuse every money system that exists, including banknotes and transparent blockchains."

        "howDoesMoneroScale": {
            "title": "How does Monero scale?",
            "content": "Monero uses dynamic block sizes and adaptive fees to handle changes in demand. When more people use Monero, blocks grow to accommodate more transactions, and fees adjust to keep things running smoothly."

            "title": "Can running a Monero node get me in trouble?",
            "content": "Running a personal node is the safest way to interact with the Monero network. Your node verifies all the rules independently and does not rely on anyone else.\n\nKeep in mind that your ISP can see you are running a Monero node."

        "hardwareRequirements": {
            "title": "What are the hardware requirements for running a Monero node?",
            "content": "A Monero full node requires at least 2 GB of RAM, 500 GB of free disk space, and a broadband internet connection with good upload and download speeds. An SSD is recommended for better performance."

        "canRunWithoutFullChain": {
            "title": "Can I run a Monero node without downloading the full chain?",
            "content": "Yes. You can run a pruned node, which stores only a portion of the blockchain data, reducing disk space requirements while still validating transactions and blocks."

            "content": "ASIC resistance means that specialized mining hardware (ASICs) do not have a big advantage over consumer hardware (CPUs/GPUs). This helps keep mining more decentralized and accessible to more people.\n\nMonero achieves ASIC resistance through the @RandomX proof-of-work algorithm, which is optimized for general-purpose CPUs."

            "title": "If everything is encrypted, how do we know coins are not created out of thin air?",
            "content": "The amounts of newly mined coins are public. Every transaction includes proofs that its hidden inputs and outputs balance out, according to the rules. If someone tried to create extra coins, the equations would not work and nodes would reject the block."

            "title": "Is Monero quantum proof?",
            "content": "Partially. Transaction privacy in Monero is quantum resistant, but the public/private key cryptography that controls ownership is not.\n\nThis is true for any blockchain that uses elliptic curve cryptography. Future quantum computers could potentially break these keys, so upgrades will be needed as quantum-safe standards develop."

            "title": "Is Monero's cryptography secure?",
            "content": "Monero has always favored established, rigorously studied cryptographic schemes. The protocol currently uses:\n 1. @Pedersen-Commitments + @Bulletproofs for confidential transaction amounts\n 2. @Curve-Trees to prove that a spent output belongs to a sender without revealing it\n 3. @Stealth-addresses for encrypting and unlinking recipient information on-chain"

Nothing was found and the supply matches the emission schedule, proving that this bug was not used in practice."

            "content": "After you have downloaded the Monero software, your antivirus or firewall may flag the executables as malware.\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n\nThis likely happens because of the integrated miner, which is used for mining and for block verification. Some antiviruses may erroneously consider the miner as dangerous software.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n1. Make sure the software you downloaded is legitimate\n2. Add an exception for it in your antivirus, so that it won't get removed or blocked"

            "content": "Monero has a main emission phase and then a small ongoing tail emission of 0.6 XMR per block to reward miners and secure the network. The result is a predictable, gently increasing supply that trends toward a stable growth rate.\n\nAs of 2025, there are approximately 18.44M XMR in circulation."

        "whatIsTailEmission": {
            "title": "What is a tail emission and why is it needed?",
            "content": "Tail emission is a constant block reward that never goes to zero. It avoids a future where miners rely only on fees and are tempted to favor large, visible payers or censor small users. A small, permanent reward helps keep security honest and decentralized."

        "tailEmissionInflation": {
            "title": "Does tail emission = endless inflation?",
            "content": "Tail emission is fixed in absolute terms, so over time it becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of the existing supply.\n\n As of 2025, the annual inflation of Monero is 0.85%, trending toward zero. \n\nThe goal is not zero new coins, but a steady, low inflation rate that can support long-term network security."
