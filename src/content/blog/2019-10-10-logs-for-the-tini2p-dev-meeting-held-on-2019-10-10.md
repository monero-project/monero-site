# Logs

**\<tini2p_gitlab>** greetings  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** 1: What's been done  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** alpha release is live!  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** master branch is tagged for alpha release 0.0.1  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** there are likely still bugs, and refactors that need to be done  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** but all the pieces are in place for the core router  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** tini2p is capable of end-to-end sessions over I2P tunnels  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** tini2p is NOT currently capable of communication with Java I2P, i2pd, or ire routers  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** in the coming weeks, I will be working on ElGamal tunnel building to enable communication with Java I2P, i2pd, and ire  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** point-to-point communication over NTCP2 is likely possible with Java I2P/i2pd/ire, but I haven't tested it at this point  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** anyone interested is welcome to pull the latest master, and test stuff out  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** any testing is very much appreciated  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** release is three months past the initial planned alpha, and I am grateful for the support and patience  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** my goal is to add client functionality, a fuzzing test suite, and core refactors by December  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** will have a longer meeting next week  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** 2: Next meeting time  
**\<tini2p_gitlab>** 2019-10-17 18:00 UTC
