  private_text: "Monero uses a cryptographically sound system that allows you to send and receive funds without your @transactions being publicly visible on the @blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and other transfers remain private by default."
  untraceable_text: "By taking advantage of @ring-signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero enables untraceable transactions. This means it's ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user."
  secure_text: "Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer @consensus network, every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual @accounts have a 25 word @mnemonic-seed displayed when created, which can be written down to back up the @account. Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are worthless if stolen."
