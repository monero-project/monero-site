### What is important to know about Monero addresses?

- **Monero addresses are never published on the blockchain**: thanks to @stealth-addresses technology, no Monero address is ever published on the public @blockchain.

- **Creating an address for each entity avoids off-chain association**: if the same address is given to more than one entity, this address can be linked to the same person if these entities collude. To avoid this risk, create a new address for each entity you will receive Monero from.

- **Creating an address for each entity allows knowing who is the sender**: since no Monero address is published on the blockchain, even the recipient wallet can't know the sender address. By creating a new address for each entity, you will always know who is sending you a transaction.

### When should a new address be created?

You should create a new address for every new entity you will receive Monero from. In practical terms, this means:

- If you are receiving from someone you have never given any address, you should create a new address for this entity
- If you are receiving from someone you already gave an address, there is no problem in reusing the same address with this entity

All funds received in these addresses will arrive in the same @wallet. It would be equivalent to giving a different email address for every person you give your email, but all messages arrive in the same inbox.

### How to create a new address in Monero GUI

Creating a new address on your wallet is quick, easy, free, and doesn't require internet connection.

1) Go to `Receive` page, which has a list of all receiving addresses generated by the currently selected account.

Note that the first address (address #0) of the first account (account #0) is your wallet `main address` and starts with `4...`. This is a special type of address that works like any other address, but can also be used for some wallet functionalities, like restoring a wallet. Also, you cannot change the label of the wallet main address.

All other addresses of your wallet are known as `subaddresses` and start with `8...`. Therefore, every time you create a new address on your wallet, a subaddress will be generated.

2) Click on `Create new address` button to generate a new address.

3) A dialog will appear asking a label for the new address. This field is optional and will be stored in your local wallet. It is for your control only and what you type here will not be sent to the sender nor be published on the blockchain.

Use this field to enter the name of the person/entity to whom you are giving this address. For instance, if you are giving this address to Bob, you can enter "Bob".

<img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/set-address-label.png" style="width: 434px;"/>

In case you are creating this address for a single transaction, you can also enter what is being paid for (product, service, donation, etc.). For instance, if Bob has to pay you 1 burger and 2 beers, you can enter "Bob (1 Burger + 2 Beers)".

4) Done! Your new address is a subaddress (starts with `8...`) and has been added to the `Addresses` list.

### How to receive a payment in Monero GUI

1) If you just want to give your address to someone, without specifying an amount or giving a description for the transaction, choose `Address` on the navigation bar.

On the top you will see some information about the address currently selected on the `Addresses` list: QR code, number (index), description, and address. The displayed QR code contains your address only.

On the bottom you will see the `Addresses` list, which contains all addresses generated on the currently selected account. If you are missing a previous address on this list, you have probably selected a wrong account on `Accounts` page or you have restored a previous wallet and the previously generated address has not received any funds yet.

<img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/address-tab.png" style="width: 548px;"/>

2) There are two ways you can give your address to someone: as text or as a QR code.

To copy an address to the clipboard as text, click on <img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/copy_button.png"> `Copy address to clipboard` button on the Addresses list. If your address is selected on the list, you can also click on the address displayed below the QR code (see the image below).

<img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/address-tab-copy-address.png" style="width: 548px;"/>

To copy an address to the clipboard as a QR code, left click on the QR code. 

To save your QR code as a PNG file, right click on it and select `Save as Image`.

3) After copying the address as text or QR code to the clipboard, you can paste it to the sender using any program of your choice (browser, email, instant messenger, etc.).

### How to create a payment request in Monero GUI

The `Payment request` option on the navigation bar should be used to:

- Request an amount to be paid
- Add a description to the request
- Add your name to the request
- Create a QR code with your name and address (to be used in your business card, stickers, website, blog, videos, podcasts, and social networks)

<img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/payment-request-tab.png" style="width: 326px;"/>

2) On `Amount` field, you can enter the amount in fiat currency (USD or EUR) or in Monero (XMR). If you are not seeing the fiat currency field, go to `Settings` > `Interface` and check `Enable displaying balance in other currencies`.

3) Use the `Description` field to enter what is being paid for (product, service, donation, etc.). This field is optional. What you write here will be seen by the sender and can be saved on the sender wallet, but it will not be published on the blockchain.

4) Use the `Your name` field to enter your name, your company, or website. This field is optional. What you write here will be seen by the sender and can be saved on the sender wallet, but it will not be published on the blockchain.

5) Next, left click the QR code to copy it to the clipboard. If you want to save the QR code as a PNG file, right click it and select `Save as Image`.

6) You can also left click the payment request text below the QR code (starting with `monero:`) to copy it to the clipboard.

7) After copying the QR code or the payment request text to the clipboard, paste it to the sender using any program of your choice (browser, email, instant messenger, etc.).

### How to check if a payment was received in Monero GUI

The `Transactions` page allows you to see if your payment was received and confirmed.

<img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/transactions_page.png" style="width: 600px;"/>

If your payment was received, it will be displayed on the Transactions page. There are two possible states for a received transaction:

<img src="/img/resources/user-guides/en/receive-payment/received-status.png" style="width: 438px;"/>

- **Received (Pending)**: the payment transaction was received by the Monero network but it is still waiting to be confirmed. Please wait for a while until a miner includes the payment transaction in a block, confirming it. This process takes on average 2 minutes, but sometimes can take longer.
- **Received**: the payment transaction was included in a block by a miner and is now considered confirmed. On `Blockheight` you can see the block number in which the transaction was included. On `Confirmations` you can see how many blocks were mined since the transaction was included in a block.
