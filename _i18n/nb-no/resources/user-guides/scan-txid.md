If you have sent or received Monero and it is not appearing in your wallet,
you can scan for the specific transaction using its ID.  After scanning is
complete, Monero should be removed or added to your balance. WARNING: this
operation may reveal the txids to the remote node and affect your privacy

### Monero GUI

1) With your wallet open, click on `Settings` -> `Wallet` -> `Scan
   transaction`
