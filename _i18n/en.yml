team:
  introduction: Workgroups are formed by community members who join forces to achieve a common goal. They have different structures and goals. On this page we list some of the more active workgroups and some tips to get you started, if you wish to contribute to any of them.
  core: Core Team
  community: Community Workgroup
  mrl: Research Lab
  descr: Description
  start: Where to start
  contacts: Chatrooms and Contacts
  chat: "Chat:"
  website: "Website:"
  core_descr: As stewards of the project, the Core Team manages and maintains infrastructure where centralization cannot be avoided (domains, website, github repositories...). Its members act as mediators as they see fit and aim to weigh consensus in the community, perpetuating the quality interactions that made Monero the successful project it is today. The Core Team does not and has never received any financial compensation.
  core_start: The Core Team is a closed workgroup; it's not possible to join unless invited.
  community_descr: This workgroup is used by the community to organize and coordinate. Start here if you are a non-coder who wants to contribute to Monero.
  community_start: The best way to start contributing to this workgroup is to join the chatrooms and introduce yourself, stating your interests and the skills you would like to offer to the community.
  devworkgroup: Development Workgroup
  devworkgroup_descr: "This workgroup unites Monero developers working on the wallets and daemon maintained by the Core Team. It consists of two main parts: the CLI team and the GUI team. These teams coordinate using two different chatrooms."
  devworkgroup_start: It's a good idea to take a look at open issues on both repositories to have an idea of what could be fixed or improved. Both codebases, but especially the core repository, can be quite challenging, so it's suggested to first write in the chatroom introducing yourself, your skills, and to what you wish to contribute.
  chatgeneral: "Chat (general):"
  chatgui: "Chat (GUI):"
  webworkgroup: Website Workgroup
  web_descr: This dev-focused workgroup coordinates the development of the website. Most members are also part of the Development Workgroup. The Website Workgroup was mostly created to have discussions related to the website all in one place.
  web_start: It's always a good idea to join the chatroom and talk directly with the members of the workgroup, but if you prefer to get started by yourself, take a look at the readme in the GitHub repository. It contains step by step instructions to edit every single part of this website.
  localization: Localization Workgroup
  localization_descr: One of the oldest Monero Workgroups, it's formed by contributors working on translating Monero-related software and documentation. It's strongly suggested to contact the workgroup before working on translations.
  localization_start: Contact the workgroup on the chatroom or open an issue on the GitHub repository. You can also start translating immediately using the Weblate platform. Just make sure to read the guide for translators first.
  locplatform: "Localization platform:"
  outreach_descr: This workgroup is focused on getting Monero out there, gathering artists, writers, and anyone who wishes to make Monero known to the world.
  outreach_start: The members of the Outreach Workgroup heavily use Telegram for coordination and matrix/freenode in minor part. If you want to help, you can contact the workgroup on one of these channels. It is quite structured, so you'll probably be directed to a coordinator.
  telegram: "Telegram chat:"
  mrl_descr: As the name suggests, the Monero Research Lab is the workgroup focused on Monero-related research. It's formed by scientists finding ways to improve Monero's protocol and features. Most of the protocol improvements that make Monero amazing, like CLSAG and @Bulletproofs, are the result of the efforts of this workgroup.
  mrl_start: Join the chatroom below and state your interests and your skills. Research is always ongoing, and somebody will point you in the right direction.
  space: Monero Space
  space_descr: Monero Space is an active, project-focused Monero workgroup that provides services to the Monero community. It hosts popular resources and organizes events such as Monero Meet.
  space_start: The workgroup can be contacted by writing to their chatroom on Freenode.
  mrw: Malware Response Workgroup
  mrw_descr: The Malware Response Workgroup provides resources and live support for multiple types of Monero-related malware.
  mrw_start: Most of the activity of this workgroup happens on the IRC chat. If you wish to contribute, just join the channel to ask questions or provide support.
  mpwg: Monero Policy Working Group
  mpwg_descr: Monero Policy Working Group is a loosely formed quorum of individuals with an interest in interacting with regulators, policy makers, and the wider financial services sector to ensure broad understanding of Monero’s component technologies, especially with regards to its compatibility with evolving regulatory and compliance requirements.

accepting:
  title_gui: Instructions for the GUI
  index: Index
  gui1: "Accepting a payment with the GUI is very easy. Doesn't matter if you are a merchant or an user, you will have two pages available: Receive and Merchants."
  gui2: The receive page (shown below) is explained in every detail
  guilinkguide: in the guide of the GUI.
  guiinstructions: >
    To receive XMR you only need to provide the payer with an @address where they can send funds to. Most of the time it's easier to just share a QR code and let the payer scan it, instead of copy-pasting the alphanumeric string.
    With the GUI every generated address come with its QR code. Make the person scan the QR code with the Monero @wallet on their phone and receive your XMR in minutes.
    Remember you can generate as many addresses (subaddresses) as you want. This is useful if you want to keep funds separated for any reason.
  guimerchant: Merchants will probably find more convenient to use the 'Merchant' page (screenshot below), which is explained in detail in the 'Merchant view' section of
  guilinkguide1: the guide linked above
  guimerchant1: >
    This is a POS-like page that merchant can easily use to set the amount of XMR to receive. If the 'Sale tracker' option is enabled,
    you will see the payments while they arrive in real time in your wallet, along with the number of confirmations.
  guisteps: "These two pages give everybody the possibility to easily receive XMR following these steps:"
  guiol: "Go to the 'Receive' page and create/select the address where you want to receive your coins."
  guiol1: Share the address composed by letters and numbers to the person you want to receive coins from. You probably prefer to use the more user friendly QR code.
  guiol2: "If you want to specify the amount to receive, go to the 'Merchant' page (after you selected in the 'Receive' page the @account that will be used to receive XMR)."
  guiol3: "Insert the amount to receive, then share with the payer the payment URL or the QR code. If you want to track the payment in real time, tick the 'enable sales tracker' option."
  guiol4: Wait until the payment has arrived and has enough confirmations (The more confirmations, the safer the transaction is. You need at least 10 confirmations before you can spend the funds.).
  cliinstructions: Instructions for the CLI
  clicreatewallet: >
    When you create your wallet for the first time, an @address will be automatically shown to you. That's your primary address.
    If you want, you can simply use that address to receive payments. You should be concerned about who knows about this address (since one address in different locations can be associated),
    but you do not need to worry about blockchain observers watching transactions to this address like with Bitcoin. A friend can send transactions to the same address without reduced privacy.
  cliaccounts: >
    You can have much more control if you want to. Monero gives the possibility to create multiple accounts, each containing multiple subaddresses,
    useful if you want to control multiple accounts. For example, you may want to have an @account for receiving donations and another one for your daily use.
    That will allow you to easily monitor incoming funds to your 'donations' account, without mixing it with your primary account.
  clicreateaccount: "To create an account, simply run this command:"
  clicreateaccount1: Now you have another account separated from your primary one. You can switch anytime between accounts.
  cliindex: >
    As you can see from the picture above, every account has an index number that you can use to switch from one account to the other using the command
    `account switch [index]`. For example, using the picture above as reference, if you would like to switch to the 'Donations' account to monitor it,
    you can do so by giving your CLI this command `account switch 1`. Now you are sitting on your 'Donations' account and you can start using it right away.
  cliindex1: >
    Every account can host a virtually infinite amount of subaddresses. These work exactly like a normal address and you can create as many
    as you want and use them to receive XMR to the account they are linked to. To create a new subaddress for an account, use the command:
  clinotes: >
    Note that the instructions below are just the minimal necessary to create and use accounts/subaddresses.
    The CLI offer more capillary ways to handle accounts and the wallet in general. Use the command 'help' to list all the available options.
  merchantstitle: Instructions for merchants
  merchantsreceive: If you are a business and you wish to programmatically receive @transactions or use advanced features like multisignature, it's suggested to consult the
  merchdevguides: developer guides
  merchantsreceive1: "If you need support, the community will always be happy to help. Come chat on #monero, the chatroom is on Freenode, but also relayed on MatterMost and Matrix."
  merchantsint: "If you prefer to not directly deal with the wallets, you can use a third party payment system. Members of the Monero community have created a set of integrations for various platforms and languages. You can find more info on"
  merchantsintlink: the GitHub organization
  merchantsthirdp: If you are looking for other third party integration system, there is a list of payment gateways on
  merchthirdlink: the merchant page
  merchantsthirdp1: Some of those offer nice features like the possibility to automatically convert part of your income in fiat money or to accept other cryptocurrencies along with Monero.

People can contribute to the development of libraries, services, documentation, graphics, etc. The list is virtually infinite. Contact or join the workgroup(s) to which you'd like to contribute.
  develop_wg: See the Monero Workgroups.
  full-node: Run a Node
  full-node_p: An easy and effective way to help the Monero network is to run a @node. Nodes ensure the network keeps running safe and decentralized. A simple fully synchronized node is enough to help the network, but if you want to go out of your way, you could run an open @remote-node, to allow other people to connect to it.
  full-node_p2: "We have several guides to help you run and configure your node:"
  allguides: See all User Guides.
  mine: Mine
  mine_p: >
    Mining ensures the safety of the network. Monero uses @randomx, an ASIC-resistant algorithm developed by Monero contributors, which aims to remain mineable by common consumer-grade hardware. For more info about mining see the
  mine_link: dedicated Mining page.
  ffs: Community Crowdfunding System
  ccs_p: Monero utilizes a community crowdfunding system whereby projects are proposed for development and community-funded. Funding is held in escrow and remunerated to developers once programming milestones are achieved. Anyone may generate new proposals or fund existing ones.
  ccsbutton: Go the the CCS
  donate: Donate
  donate_p: Donations to the general fund are used to pay the salary of core's assistant Rehrar and in case of emergencies or need. Infrastructure costs are currently covered by sponsors.

  acontribute4: "The Outreach workgroup wrote a useful article to help newcomers:"
  q1: How does Monero have value?
  a1: Monero has value because people are willing to buy it. If no one is willing to buy Monero, then it will not have any value. Monero’s price increases if demand exceeds supply, and it decreases if supply exceeds demand.
  q2: How can I get Monero?
  a2: You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Exchanges are the most common way to buy Monero; there are compliant exchanges in most jurisdictions. Some wallets include functionality to easily buy Monero with fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, you can try mining Monero to get coins from the @block reward.
  a2exchanges: "In past, you needed Bitcoin to buy Monero, but that's not the case anymore. You can directly trade Monero for national currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc) or other cryptocurrencies on many exchanges. Some require KYC (proof of identification); others do not, like decentralized exchanges. On this website is available a list of exchanges where it's possible to buy/sell Monero (XMR):"
  q3: Why is the Mnemonic Seed important?
  a3: A @mnemonic-seed is a set of 25 words that can be used to restore your account anywhere. Keep these words safe and do not share them with someone else. You can use this seed to restore your account, even if your computer crashes.
  q4: How is Monero’s privacy different from other coins?
  a4: "Monero uses three different privacy technologies: @ring-signatures, ring confidential transactions (@RingCT), and @stealth-addresses. These hide the sender, amount, and receiver in the @transaction, respectively. All transactions on the network are private by mandate; there is no way to accidentally send a transparent transaction. This feature is exclusive to Monero. You do not need to trust anyone else with your privacy."
  q5: Why is my wallet taking so long to sync?
  a5: If you are running a full @node locally, you need to copy the entire @blockchain to your computer. This can take a long time, especially on an old hard drive or slow internet connection. If you are using a @remote-node, your computer still needs to request a copy of all the outputs, which can take several hours. Be patient, and if you would like to sacrifice some privacy for faster sync times, consider using a remote node or lightweight @wallet instead.
  q6: What is the difference between a lightweight and a normal wallet?
  a6: For a lightweight wallet, you give your view key to a node, who scans the blockchain and looks for incoming transactions to your account on your behalf. This node will know when you receive money, but it will not know how much you receive, who you received it from, or who you are sending money to. Depending on your wallet software, you may be able to use a node you control to avoid privacy leaks. For more privacy, use a normal wallet, which can be used with your own node.
  q7: How is Monero different from Bitcoin?
  a7: Monero is not based on Bitcoin. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Bitcoin is a completely transparent system, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another. Monero hides this information to protect user privacy in all transactions. It also has a dynamic @block size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work (RandomX), and a @tail-emission, among several other changes.
  q8: Does Monero have a block size limit?
  a8: No, Monero does not have a hard @block size limit. Instead, the block size can increase or decrease over time based on demand. It is capped at a certain growth rate to prevent outrageous growth (@scalability).
  q11: What is fungibility, and why is it important?
  a11: "@Fungibility is a simple property of money such that there are no differences between two amounts of the same value. If two people exchanged a 10 and two 5’s, then no one would lose out. However, let’s suppose that everyone knows the 10 was previously used in a ransomware attack. Is the other person still going to make the trade? Probably not, even if the person with the 10 has no connection with the ransomware. This is a problem, since the receiver of money needs to constantly check the money they are receiving to not end up with tainted coins. Monero is fungible, which means people do not need to go through this effort."
  q12: If Monero is so private how do we know they're not being created out of thin air?
  a12-1: In Monero, every @transaction output is uniquely associated with a key image that can only be generated by the holder of that output. Key images that are used more than once are rejected by the miners as double-spends and cannot be added to a valid @block. When a new transaction is received, miners verify that the key image does not already exist for a previous transaction to ensure it's not a double-spend.
  a12-2: We can also know that transaction amounts are valid even though the value of the inputs that you are spending and the value of the outputs you are sending are encrypted (these are hidden to everyone except the recipient). Because the amounts are encrypted using @Pedersen-commitments what this means is that no observers can tell the amounts of the inputs and outputs, but they can do math on the Pedersen commitments to determine that no Monero was created out of thin air.
  a12-3: As long as the encrypted output amounts you create is equal to the sum of the inputs that are being spent (which include an output for the recipient and a change output back to yourself and the unencrypted transaction fee), then you have a legitimate transaction and know no Monero is being created out of thin air. Pedersen commitments mean that the sums can be verified as being equal, but the Monero value of each of the sums and the Monero value of the inputs and outputs individually are undeterminable.
  q13: Is Monero magic and protects my privacy no matter what I do?
  a13: Monero is not magic. If you use Monero but give your name and address to another party, the other party will not magically forget your name and address. If you give out your secret keys, others will know what you've done. If you get compromised, others will be able to keylog you. If you use a weak password, others will be able to brute force your keys file. If you backup your seed in the cloud, you'll be poorer soon.
  q14: Is Monero 100% anonymous?
  a14: There is no such thing as 100% anonymous. If nothing else, your anonymity set is the set of people using Monero. Some people don't use Monero. Monero may also have bugs. Even if not, ways may exist to infer some information through Monero's privacy layers, either now or later. Attacks only get better. If you wear a seatbelt, you can still die in a car crash. Use common sense, prudence and defense in depth.
  q15: Is Monero a mixer or mixing service?
  a15: No. Monero uses a completely non-interactive, non-custodial, and automatic process to create private transactions. By contrast for mixing services, users opt-in to participate.
  qwallet: What wallet should I use?
  awallet: There are multiple wallets available for a vast number of platforms. On this website you'll find the wallets released by the Core Team (GUI and CLI) and a list of widely trusted and open source third party wallets for desktop and mobile.
  qnofunds: I can't see my funds. Did I just lose all my Monero?
  anofunds: "You probably didn't. It's very hard to simply 'lose' your coins, since they are technically nowhere. Your coins 'live' on the blockchain and are linked to your account through a system of public and private keys secured by cryptography. That's why if you don't see your funds, it's probably because of a technical issue. Take a look at the 'Resources & Help' section at the top of this page for a list of useful resources that will help you identify and fix your problem."
  qnodetor: How can I connect my node via Tor?
  anodetor: Support for Tor is still in its infancies, but it's already possible to natively send transactions through the network and to run a Monero @daemon on the Tor network. Better Tor and I2P integrations are in progress.
  qfullpruned: How do I decide if I should run a full node or a pruned node?
  afullpruned: "A full @node requires a considerable amount of storage and could take a long time to download and verify the entire blockchain, especially on older hardware. If you have limited storage, a pruned node is recommended. It only stores 1/8th of unnecessary blockchain data while keeping the full transaction history. If plenty of storage is available, a full node is recommended but a pruned node still greatly contributes to the network and improves your privacy."
  qblocksize: How big is the Monero blockchain?
  ablocksize: "The Monero @blockchain is always growing so there is no fixed size. As of 2021, the full blockchain is around 95-100GB. A pruned blockchain is about 30GB. Check out Moneropedia entry @pruning to learn the difference between a full and a pruned blockchain."
  qblockspace: Why does the blockchain need so much space?
  ablockspace: "When you download the @blockchain, you are downloading the entire history of the @transactions that happened in the Monero network since it was created. The transactions and the related data are heavy and the entire history must be kept by every node to ensure it's the same for everybody. @Pruning a blockchain allows to run a node which keeps only 1/8 of not strictly necessary blockchain data. This results in a blockchain 2/3 smaller than a full one. Convenient for people with limited disk space. Check out the Moneropedia entries @node and @remote-node for more details."
  qavoidbc: Can I avoid downloading the entire blockchain?
  aavoidbc: "Yes. You don't need to download the @blockchain to transact on the network. You can connect to a @remote-node, which stores the blockchain for you. All the most common @wallets (including GUI and CLI) allow to use remote nodes to transact on the network. There are multiple ways to take advantage of this functionality. For example GUI and CLI offer a 'bootstrap node' feature, which allow people to download their own blockchain while using a remote node to immediately use the network. Ways to improve the usability of the Monero network are constantly being explored."
  qscanned: Why my wallet needs to be scanned everytime I open it?
  ascanned: Because new @transactions have been recorded on the @blockchain from the last time you opened your wallet, which needs to scan all of them to make sure non of those transaction is yours. This process is not necessary in a mymonero-style (openmonero) wallet, a central server (which could be managed by you) does this work for you.
  qdangernode: Is it dangerous to run a personal node?
  adangernode: "Running a personal @node is the safest way to interact with the Monero network, because you are in full control and you don't need to rely on third parties. From a general point of view running a node is not dangerous, but keep in mind that your ISP can see you are running a Monero node."
  qdangerrnode: Is it dangerous to use a remote node? What's the data a node operator can get from me?
  adangerrnode: "It's always advisable, especially for privacy-conscious users, to use a personal node when transacting on the network to achieve the highest rate of privacy. Some people for convenience prefer to use @remote-node which are not under their control (public nodes). The convenience of not having to deal with a personal copy of the @blockchain comes at a cost: lessened privacy. A remote node operator is able to see from what IP address a transaction comes from (even if cannot see the recipient nor the amount) and in some extreme cases, can make attacks able to reduce your privacy. Some dangers can be mitigated by using remote nodes on the Tor or I2P networks or using a VPN."
  qantivirus: Why is my antivirus/firewall flagging the Monero software i just downloaded as malware?
  aantivirus: After you have downloaded the Monero software (GUI and CLI alike), your antivirus or firewall may flag the executables as malware. Some antiviruses only warn you about the possible menace, others go as far as silently removing your downloaded @wallet / @daemon. This likely happens because of the integrated miner, which is used for mining and for @block verification. Some antiviruses may erroneously consider the miner as dangerous software and act to remove it.
  aantivirus1: The problem is being discussed and solutions are being elaborated. In the meantime, if you get a warning from your antivirus, make sure the software you downloaded is legitimate (see the guides linked below), then add an exception for it in your antivirus, so that it won't get removed or blocked. If you need assistance, feel free to contact the community.
  qmoneromeaning: "Why is Monero called 'Monero'?"
  amoneromeaning: "Monero is an Esperanto word which means 'coin'. Initially Monero was called 'Bitmonero', which translates to 'Bitcoin' in Esperanto. After the community decided to fork from the original maintainer, 'bit' was dropped in favour of simply 'Monero'."
  qimporting: Can I manually import the blockchain?
  aimporting: >
    Yes, you can, but you probably shouldn't. Importing an external @blockchain is very resource intensive and forces you to trust the entity providing you with the blockchain. It's usually faster to download it the normal way: running a node and letting it synchronize with the other @nodes in the network. If you really need to import an external blockchain, you can download one in the 'Downloads' page of this website. Follow the guide below if you are using Windows. If you are a linux user, you can use the tool "monero-blockchain-import", which is included in the archive when you download the GUI or CLI wallets. Start syncing the imported blockchain with this command: "monero-blockchain-import --input-file blockchain.raw".
  qhf: Is it true that Monero has a hard fork every 6 months?
  ahf: Monero used to have 2 network upgrades (hard forks) a year, but this is not the case anymore. The choice of the biannual hard forks was taken in order to be able to introduce important consensus changes, which added privacy features and network-wide improvements (For example @bulletproofs and CLSAG both required a hard fork) and avoid the ossification of the protocol. Recently, the biannual hard forks included changes to the PoW algorithm, to preserve ASIC-resistance.
  ahf1: The dev community and the Core Team agree that the protocol is stable and mature enough and biannual hard forks are not necessary anymore. Furthermore, the ecosystem around Monero has grown exponentially during the years and frequent protocol changes would be increasingly hard to coordinate, could be detrimental to the growth of the ecosystem and to the user experience. Cherry on the top, the new algorithm @RandomX is ensuring long term ASIC-resistance, so regular changes are not needed anymore. Network upgrades will still be used to add important protocol improvements and consensus changes, but at a lower and less strict frequency (every 9-12 months).
  qvideos: Are there videos I can watch to learn about Monero?
  avideos: >
    During the years the community has created a vast amount of informative content like articles and videos. Most of these videos are publicly available on platforms like YouTube.

  qlongtimemove: I haven't touched my Monero in a long time, did I lose my coins as a consequence of a hard fork (network upgrade)?
  alongtimemove: Don't worry, your coins are safe. To be able to spend them you only have to download and run the latest Monero software. You can use the @mnemonic-seed you previously saved to restore your wallet at any time. Note that hard forks in Monero are scheduled and non-contentious. Which means no new coin is created.

mining:
  intro1: Monero is a cryptocurrency that relies on proof-of-work mining to achieve distributed consensus. Below you'll find some information and resources on how to begin mining.

what-is-monero:
  need-to-know: What you need to know
  leading: Monero is the leading cryptocurrency focused on private and censorship-resistant transactions.
  leading_para1: The majority of existing @cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent @blockchains. Transactions can be verified and/or traced by anyone in the world. This means that the sending and receiving @addresses of these @transactions could potentially be linked to real-world identities.
  leading_para2: Monero, on the other hand, uses various privacy-enhancing technologies to ensure the anonymity of its users. 
  confidential: Monero transactions are confidential and untraceable.
  confidential_para1: "Unlike selectively transparent alternatives (e.g. Zcash), Monero is the only cryptocurrency where every user is anonymous by default. The sender, receiver, and amount of every single transaction are hidden through the use of three important technologies: @Stealth-Addresses, @Ring-Signatures, and @RingCT."
  confidential_para2: Because every transaction is private, Monero cannot be traced. This makes it a true, @fungible currency. Merchants and individuals accepting Monero do not need to worry about blacklisted or tainted coins.
  grassroots: Monero is a grassroots community attracting the world's best cryptocurrency researchers and engineering talent.
  grassroots_p1: The Monero Project is at the forefront of cryptocurrency privacy and security. Its 
  grassroots_p2: Research Lab
  grassroots_p3: and Development Team are constantly working on new, innovative technologies. Since its launch, the project has received contributions from over
  grassroots_p4: 500 developers
  grassroots_p5: located all around the world.
  grassroots_p6: Numerous 
  grassroots_p7: forums and chat channels
  grassroots_p8: are available for anyone to join, and the community is always welcoming new members.
  electronic: Monero is electronic cash that allows fast, inexpensive payments to and from anywhere in the world.
  electronic_para1: With Monero, there are no wire transfer or check clearing fees, no multi-day holding periods, and no fraudulent chargebacks. Because Monero is decentralized, it is not constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction and provides safety from capital control.

about:
  history: A Brief History
  history_para1: Monero was launched in April 2014. It was a fair, pre-announced launch of the CryptoNote reference code. There was no premine or instamine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread
  history_para2: here.
  history_para3: The founder, thankful_for_today, proposed some controversial changes that the community disagreed with. A fallout ensued, and the Monero Core Team forked the project with the community following this new Core Team. This Core Team has provided oversight since.
  history_para4: Monero has made several large improvements since launch. The blockchain was migrated to a different database structure to provide greater efficiency and flexibility, minimum ring signature sizes were set so that all transactions were private by mandate, and RingCT was implemented to hide the transaction amounts. Nearly all improvements have provided improvements to security or privacy, or they have facilitated use. Monero continues to develop with goals of privacy and security first, ease of use and efficiency second.
  values: Our Values
  values_para: Monero is more than just a technology. It’s also what the technology stands for. Some of the important guiding philosophies are listed below.
  security: Security
  security_para: Users must be able to trust Monero with their transactions, without risk of error or attack. Monero gives the full block reward to the miners, who are the most critical members of the network who provide this security. Transactions are cryptographically secure using the latest and most resilient encryption tools available.
  privacy: Privacy
  privacy_para: Monero takes privacy seriously. Monero needs to be able to protect users in a court of law and, in extreme cases, from the death penalty. This level of privacy must be completely accessible to all users, whether they are technologically competent or have no idea how Monero works. A user needs to confidently trust Monero in a way that this person does not feel pressured into changing their spending habits for risk of others finding out.
  decentralization: Decentralization
  decentralization_para: Monero is committed to providing the highest degree of decentralization in both network security and code development. Its Proof of Work algorithm prevents specialized mining hardware from dominating the network and allows for fair distribution of block rewards. Additionally, Monero's development and research are conducted via global collaboration, and the project is carried out with utmost transparency. Each development decision is open to public discussion, and every major developer meeting is published online.

  abstract: Abstract
  introduction: Introduction
  read-paper: Read Paper
  summary: Summary
  mrlhtp: Understanding ge_fromfe_frombytes_vartime
  mrlhtp_summary: Monero uses a unique hash function that transforms scalars into elliptic curve points. It is useful for creating key images, in particular. This document, authored by Shen Noether, translates its code implementation (the ge_fromfe_frombytes_vartime() function) into mathematical expressions.
  mrl1: A Note on Chain Reactions in Traceability in CryptoNote 2.0
  mrl1_abstract: This research bulletin describes a plausible attack on a ring-signature based anonymity system. We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote 2.0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012. It has been previously demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one-time key pair can be dependent upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that ring signature. This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability between ring signatures, causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole network if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sufficient percentage of the network. The signatures are still one-time, however, and any such attack will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users. However, such an attack could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against blockchain analysis. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl2: Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol
  mrl2_abstract: On 4 September 2014, an unusual and novel attack was executed against the Monero cryptocurrency network. This attack partitioned the network into two distinct subsets which refused to accept the legitimacy of the other subset. This had myriad effects, not all of which are yet known. The attacker had a short window of time during which a sort of counterfeiting could occur, for example. This research bulletin describes deficiencies in the CryptoNote reference code allowing for this attack, describes the solution initially put forth by Rafal Freeman from Tigusoft.pl and subsequently by the CryptoNote team, describes the current fix in the Monero code base, and elaborates upon exactly what the offending block did to the network. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl3: Monero is Not That Mysterious
  mrl3_abstract: Recently, there have been some vague fears about the CryptoNote source code and protocol floating around the internet based on the fact that it is a more complicated protocol than, for instance, Bitcoin. The purpose of this note is to try and clear up some misconceptions, and hopefully remove some of the mystery surrounding Monero Ring Signatures. I will start by comparing the mathematics involved in CryptoNote ring signatures (as described in [CN]) to the mathematics in [FS], on which CryptoNote is based. After this, I will compare the mathematics of the ring signature to what is actually in the CryptoNote codebase.
  mrl4: Improving Obfuscation in the CryptoNote Protocol
  mrl4_abstract: We identify several blockchain analysis attacks available to degrade the untraceability of the CryptoNote 2.0 protocol. We analyze possible solutions, discuss the relative merits and drawbacks to those solutions, and recommend improvements to the Monero protocol that will hopefully provide long-term resistance of the cryptocurrency against blockchain analysis. Our recommended improvements to Monero include a protocol-level network-wide minimum mix-in policy of n = 2 foreign outputs per ring signature, a protocol-level increase of this value to n = 4 after two years, and a wallet-level default value of n = 4 in the interim. We also recommend a torrent-style method of sending Monero output. We also discuss a non-uniform, age-dependent mix-in selection method to mitigate the other forms of blockchain analysis identified herein, but we make no formal recommendations on implementation for a variety of reasons. The ramifications following these improvements are also discussed in some detail. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl5: Ring Signature Confidential Transactions
  mrl5_abstract: This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof of work “mining” process. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. Some extensions of the protocol are provided, such as Aggregate Schnorr Range Proofs, and Ring Multisignature. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the bitcoin research irc channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available in [14] showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.
  mrl6: An Efficient Implementation of Monero Subaddresses
  mrl6_abstract: Users of the Monero cryptocurrency who wish to reuse wallet addresses in an unlinkable way must maintain separate wallets, which necessitates scanning incoming transactions for each one. We document a new address scheme that allows a user to maintain a single master wallet address and generate an arbitrary number of unlinkable subaddresses. Each transaction needs to be scanned only once to determine if it is destinated for any of the user’s subaddresses. The scheme additionally supports multiple outputs to other subaddresses, and is as efficient as traditional wallet transactions.
  mrl7: Sets of Spent Outputs
  mrl7_abstract: This technical note generalizes the concept of spend outputs using basic set theory. The definition captures a variety of earlier work on identifying such outputs. We quantify the effects of this analysis on the Monero blockchain and give a brief overview of mitigations.
  mrl8: Dual Linkable Ring Signatures
  mrl8_abstract: This bulletin describes a modification to Monero's linkable ring signature scheme that permits dual-key outputs as ring members. Key images are tied to both output one-time public keys in a dual, preventing both keys in that transaction from being spent separately. This method has applications to non-interactive refund transactions. We discuss the security implications of the scheme.
  mrl9: Thring Signatures and their Applications to Spender-Ambiguous Digital Currencies
  mrl9_abstract: We present threshold ring multi-signatures (thring signatures) for collaborative computation of ring signatures, present a game of existential forgery for thring signatures, and discuss uses of thring signatures in digital currencies that include spender-ambiguous cross-chain atomic swaps for confidential amounts without a trusted setup. We present an implementation of thring signatures that we call linkable spontaneous threshold anonymous group signatures, and prove the implementation existentially unforgeable.
  mrl10: Discrete Logarithm Equality Across Groups
  mrl10_abstract: This technical note describes an algorithm used to prove knowledge of the same discrete logarithm across different groups. The scheme expresses the common value as a scalar representation of bits, and uses a set of ring signatures to prove each bit is a valid value that is the same (up to an equivalence) across both scalar groups.
  iacr2019654: Concise Linkable Ring Signatures and Forgery Against Adversarial Keys
  iacr2019654_abstract: We demonstrate that a version of non-slanderability is a natural definition of unforgeability for linkable ring signatures. We present a linkable ring signature construction with concise signatures and multi-dimensional keys that is linkably anonymous if a variation of the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem with random oracles is hard, linkable if key aggregation is a one-way function, and non-slanderable if a one-more variation of the discrete logarithm problem is hard. We remark on some applications in signer-ambiguous confidential transaction models without trusted setup.
  iacr2020018: "Triptych: logarithmic-sized linkable ring signatures with applications"
  iacr2020018_abstract: Ring signatures are a common construction used to provide signer ambiguity among a non-interactive set of public keys specified at the time of signing. Unlike early approaches where signature size is linear in the size of the signer anonymity set, current optimal solutions either require centralized trusted setups or produce signatures logarithmic in size. However, few also provide linkability, a property used to determine whether the signer of a message has signed any previous message, possibly with restrictions on the anonymity set choice. Here we introduce Triptych, a family of linkable ring signatures without trusted setup that is based on generalizations of zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of commitment openings to zero. We demonstrate applications of Triptych in signer-ambiguous transaction protocols by extending the construction to openings of parallel commitments in independent anonymity sets. Signatures are logarithmic in the anonymity set size and, while verification complexity is linear, collections of proofs can be efficiently verified in batches. We show that for anonymity set sizes practical for use in distributed protocols, Triptych offers competitive performance with a straightforward construction.
  iacr2020312: "Arcturus: efficient proofs for confidential transactions"
  iacr2020312_note: "NOTE: this paper has been retracted, but it's possible to view it clicking on 'All versions of this report'."
  iacr2020312_abstract: Confidential transactions are used in distributed digital assets to demonstrate the balance of values hidden in commitments, while retaining signer ambiguity. Previous work describes a signer-ambiguous proof of knowledge of the opening of commitments to zero at the same index across multiple public commitment sets and the evaluation of a verifiable random function used as a linking tag, and uses this to build a linkable ring signature called Triptych that can be used as a building block for a confidential transaction model. In this work, we extend Triptych to build Arcturus, a proving system that proves knowledge of openings of multiple commitments to zero within a single set, correct construction of a verifiable random function evaluated at each opening, and value balance across a separate list of commitments within a single proof. While soundness depends on a novel dual discrete-logarithm hardness assumption, we use data from the Monero blockchain to show that Arcturus can be used in a confidential transaction model to provide faster total batch verification time than other state-of-the-art constructions without a trusted setup.
