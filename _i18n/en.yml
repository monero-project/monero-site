  private_text: "Monero uses hidden amounts, origins and destinations of @transactions. This means that nobody knows how much you're sending in a transaction except you. This ensures that your purchases and other transfers remain private by default."
  untraceable_text: "By taking advantage of @ring-signatures, Monero allows you to send and receive funds privately. Even though your transactions are publicly verifiable on the @blockchain, transactions use digital signatures that specify a group of signers such that the person verifying can’t tell which person actually produced the signature. Because it's ambiguous which funds have been spent, your transaction remains private and cannot be traced back to you."
  secure_text: "Monero uses a distributed peer-to-peer @consensus network and every transaction is cryptographically signed. Your coins are safely stored on the @blockchain and can be restored at any time with the use of a 25 word @mnemonic-seed on any computer with the Monero software. Wallet files are encrypted on disk and locked with a passphrase, rendering them useless if stolen."
