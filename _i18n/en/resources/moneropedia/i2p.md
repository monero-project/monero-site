### Monero

For Monero's implementation of @I2P, see @Kovri. For a comparison of @I2P to [Tor](https://torproject.org/), read the [Comparison](https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor) page.

### The Basics

From @Java-I2P:

>The I2P network provides strong privacy protections for communication over the Internet. Many activities that would risk your privacy on the public Internet can be conducted anonymously inside I2P.

### In-depth information

From @Java-I2P:

>I2P is an anonymous overlay network - a network within a network. It is intended to protect communication from dragnet surveillance and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs.

>I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists, oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as the average person.

>No network can be "perfectly anonymous". The continued goal of I2P is to make attacks more and more difficult to mount. Its anonymity will get stronger as the size of the network increases and with ongoing academic review.

### Notes

@I2P documentation and specifications are available [here](https://geti2p.net/docs/).
