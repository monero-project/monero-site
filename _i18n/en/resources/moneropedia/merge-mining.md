### The Basics

Merge mining is the process of @mining two or more @blockchains at the same time. Generally there is a parent @blockchain and an auxillary blockchain both of which use the same proof of work algorithm. In most cases the auxillary chain will have a lower difficulty than the parent block chain.

Merge mining can be used for securing a lower hashrate blockchain or developing a @sidechain that does something different than the primary chain.
Some examples that currently exist or are in development are: a blockchain game [TownForge](https://townforge.net/about), digital assets platform [Tari](https://www.tari.com/#what-is-tari) or a decentralized mining pool (@P2Pool).
