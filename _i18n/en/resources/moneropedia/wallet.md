### The Basics

A Monero account, or wallet, stores the information necessary to send and receive Moneroj.  In addition to sending and receiving, the Monero Wallet software keeps a private history of your transactions and allows you to cryptographically sign messages.  It also includes Monero mining software and an address book.

The term "hot wallet" describes a Monero @account which is connected to the Internet.  You can send funds easily but security is much lower than a cold wallet.  Never store large amounts of cryptocurrency in a hot wallet!

A cold wallet is generated on a trusted device or computer via an @airgap.  If the device is to be reused, the data storage should be securely overwritten.  As soon as a cold wallet is connected to the Internet or its mnemonic phrase or @spend-key is entered on an Internet-connected device, it's no longer "cold" and should be considered "hot".

A Monero @paper-wallet can be generated by downloading the source code of https://moneroaddress.org/.  Verify the signature of the code on a trusted airgapped device.  Create the wallet and print or store it on the media of your choice.

Monero accounts and paper-wallets can be stored on any media - paper, USB drive, CD/DVD, or a hardware wallet device (Ledger available since June 2018).
