msgid "Monero P2Pool is a peer-to-peer Monero @mining pool developed by SChernykh (also known as sech1). P2Pool was a concept first developed for the Bitcoin blockchain but was never fully realized due to certain limitations, mainly because it had a problem with orphaned @blocks which is solved in Monero P2Pool with uncle blocks."

msgid "Unlike a traditional mining pool, P2Pool allows it's users to fully control their own @node and what it mines. P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to @merge-mine with Monero. It is designed so that all blocks found by the pool pay out to the miners immediately which means that funds are never in custody of a single party."

msgid "To accomplish this P2Pool uses PPLNS payout scheme which rewards miners only once the block has been found by the pool; miners with a share in the PPLNS window are rewarded directly via the @coinbase-transaction reward for the block."

msgid "P2Pool is a @sidechain to Monero, and P2Pool blocks are potentially Monero @blocks. Each miner submits block templates that include a payout for all of the miners that currently have shares in the PPLNS window. High quality block templates are added to the P2Pool blockchain as blocks which count as \"shares\" for the miner who found them."
