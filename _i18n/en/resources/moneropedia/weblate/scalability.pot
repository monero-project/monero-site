msgid "The size of Monero @blocks (which contain @transactions) is flexible and can accommodate many transactions as demand changes. Formulas determine how the reward miners receive interacts with the number of transactions they choose to include in blocks. The @blockchain can therefore scale to meet changes in transaction volume."

msgid "Scaling may also refer to the ability to conduct certain types of intermediate transactions safely without interacting with a blockchain. Monero does not currently support native off-chain solutions like atomic swaps, since its privacy features do not permit the use of required functionality like non-interactive refund transactions or complex scripting. However, academic and industry research is ongoing and promising in this area."
