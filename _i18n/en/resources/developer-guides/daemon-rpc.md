## Introduction

This is a list of the monerod daemon RPC calls, their inputs and outputs, and examples of each.

Many RPC calls use the daemon's JSON RPC interface while others use their own interfaces, as demonstrated below.

Note: "atomic units" refer to the smallest fraction of 1 XMR according to the monerod implementation. **1 XMR = 1e12 atomic units.**

## JSON RPC Methods

The majority of monerod RPC calls use the daemon's `json_rpc` interface to request various bits of information. These methods all follow a similar structure, for example:

```
IP=127.0.0.1
PORT=18081
METHOD='getblockheaderbyheight'
PARAMS='{"height":912345}'
curl \
    -X POST http://$IP:$PORT/json_rpc \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"'$METHOD'","params":'$PARAMS'}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Some methods include parameters, while others do not. Examples of each JSON RPC method follow.

### **getblockcount**

Look up how many blocks are in the longest chain known to the node.

Inputs: *None*.

Outputs:

* *count* - unsigned int; Number of blocks in longest chain seen by the node.
* *status* - string; General RPC error code. "OK" means everything looks good.

Example:

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"getblockcount"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  

{  
  "id": "0",  
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",  
  "result": {  
    "count": 993163,  
    "status": "OK"  
  }  
}  
```


### **on_getblockhash**

Look up a block's hash by its height.

Inputs:

* block height (int array of length 1)
  
Outputs:

* block hash (string)

  }
}
```


### **submitblock**

Submit a mined block to the network.

Inputs:

* Block blob data - string

Outputs:

* *status* - string; Block submit status.


### **getlastblockheader**

Block header information for the most recent block is easily retrieved with this method. No inputs are needed.

Inputs: *None*.

Outputs:

* *block_header* - A structure containing block header information.
  * *depth* -  unsigned int; The number of blocks succeeding this block on the blockchain. A larger number means an older block.
  * *difficulty* - unsigned int; The strength of the Monero network based on mining power.
  * *hash* - string; The hash of this block.
  * *height* - unsigned int; The number of blocks preceding this block on the blockchain.

  * *minor_version* - unsigned int; The minor version of the monero protocol at this block height.
  * *nonce* - unsigned int; a cryptographic random one-time number used in mining a Monero block.
  * *orphan_status* - boolean; Usually `false`. If `true`, this block is not part of the longest chain.
  * *prev_hash* - string; The hash of the block immediately preceding this block in the chain.
  * *reward* - unsigned int; The amount of new atomic units generated in this block and rewarded to the miner. Note: 1 XMR = 1e12 atomic units.
  * *timestamp* - unsigned int; The time the block was recorded into the blockchain.
* *status* - string; General RPC error code. "OK" means everything looks good.

In this example, the most recent block (990793 at the time) is returned:

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"getlastblockheader"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

{
  "id": "0",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "block_header": {
      "depth": 0,
      "difficulty": 746963928,
      "hash": "ac0f1e226268d45c99a16202fdcb730d8f7b36ea5e5b4a565b1ba1a8fc252eb0",
      "height": 990793,
      "major_version": 1,

      "timestamp": 1457589942
    },
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```


### **getblockheaderbyhash**

Block header information can be retrieved using either a block's hash or height. This method includes a block's hash as an input parameter to retrieve basic information about the block.

Inputs:

* *hash* - string; The block's sha256 hash.

Outputs:

* *block_header* - A structure containing block header information. See [getlastblockheader](#getlastblockheader).

In this example, block 912345 is looked up by its hash:

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"getblockheaderbyhash","params":{"hash":"e22cf75f39ae720e8b71b3d120a5ac03f0db50bba6379e2850975b4859190bc6"}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

{
  "id": "0",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "block_header": {
      "depth": 78376,
      "difficulty": 815625611,
      "hash": "e22cf75f39ae720e8b71b3d120a5ac03f0db50bba6379e2850975b4859190bc6",
      "height": 912345,
      "major_version": 1,
      "minor_version": 2,
      "nonce": 1646,
      "orphan_status": false,
      "prev_hash": "b61c58b2e0be53fad5ef9d9731a55e8a81d972b8d90ed07c04fd37ca6403ff78",
      "reward": 7388968946286,
      "timestamp": 1452793716
    },
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```


### **getblockheaderbyheight**

Similar to `getblockheaderbyhash` above, this method includes a block's height as an input parameter to retrieve basic information about the block.

Inputs:

* *height* - unsigned int; The block's height.

Outputs:

* *block_header* - A structure containing block header information. See [getlastblockheader](#getlastblockheader).

In this example, block 912345 is looked up by its height (notice that the returned information is the save as in the previous example):

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"getblockheaderbyheight","params":{"height":912345}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

{
  "id": "0",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "block_header": {
      "depth": 78376,
      "difficulty": 815625611,
      "hash": "e22cf75f39ae720e8b71b3d120a5ac03f0db50bba6379e2850975b4859190bc6",
      "height": 912345,
      "major_version": 1,
      "minor_version": 2,
      "nonce": 1646,
      "orphan_status": false,
      "prev_hash": "b61c58b2e0be53fad5ef9d9731a55e8a81d972b8d90ed07c04fd37ca6403ff78",
      "reward": 7388968946286,
      "timestamp": 1452793716
    },
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```


### **getblock**

Full block information can be retrieved by either block height or hash, like with the above block header calls. For full block information, both lookups use the same method, but with different input parameters.

Inputs (pick one of the following):

* *height* - unsigned int; The block's height.
* *hash* - string; The block's hash.

Outputs:

* *blob* - string; Hexadecimal blob of block information.
* *block_header* - A structure containing block header information. See [getlastblockheader](#getlastblockheader).
* *json* - json string; JSON formatted block details:
  * *major_version* - Same as in block header.
  * *minor_version* - Same as in block header.
  * *timestamp* - Same as in block header.
  * *prev_id* - Same as `prev_hash` in block header.
  * *nonce* - Same as in block header.
  * *miner_tx* - Miner transaction information
    * *version* - Transaction version number.
    * *unlock_time* - The block height when the coinbase transaction becomes spendable.
    * *vin* - List of transaction inputs:
      * *gen* - Miner txs are coinbase txs, or "gen".
        * *height* - This block height, a.k.a. when the coinbase is generated.
    * *vout* - List of transaction outputs. Each output contains:
      * *amount* - The amount of the output, in atomic units.
      * *target* - 
        * *key* - 
    * *extra* - Usually called the "transaction ID" but can be used to include any random 32 byte/64 character hex string.
    * *signatures* - Contain signatures of tx signers. Coinbased txs do not have signatures.
  * *tx_hashes* - List of hashes of non-coinbase transactions in the block. If there are no other transactions, this will be an empty list.
* *status* - string; General RPC error code. "OK" means everything looks good.

**Look up by height:**

In the following example, block 912345 is looked up by its height. Note that block 912345 does not have any non-coinbase transactions. (See the next example for a block with extra transactions):

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"getblock","params":{"height":912345}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

## Other Daemon RPC Calls

Not all daemon RPC calls use the JSON_RPC interface. This section gives examples of these calls.

The data structure for these calls is different than the JSON RPC calls. Whereas the JSON RPC methods were called using the `/json_rpc` extension and specifying a method, these methods are called at their own extensions. For example:

    IP=127.0.0.1
    PORT=18081
    METHOD='gettransactions'
	PARAMS='{"txs_hashes":["d6e48158472848e6687173a91ae6eebfa3e1d778e65252ee99d7515d63090408"]}'
	curl \
		-X POST http://$IP:$PORT/$METHOD \
		-d $PARAMS \
		-H 'Content-Type: application/json'

Note: It is recommended to use JSON RPC where such alternatives exist, rather than the following methods. For example, the recommended way to get a node's height is via the JSON RPC methods [get_info](#getinfo) or [getlastblockheader](#getlastblockheader), rather than [getheight](#getheight) below.


### **/getheight**

Get the node's current height.

Inputs: *None*.

Outputs:

* *height* - unsigned int; Current length of longest chain known to daemon. 

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/getheight -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

{
  "height": 993488,
  "status": "OK"
}
```


### **/gettransactions**

Look up one or more transactions by hash.

Inputs:

* *txs_hashes* - string list; List of transaction hashes to look up.
* *decode_as_json* - boolean; Optional. If set `true`, the returned transaction information will be decoded rather than binary.

Outputs:

* *status* - General RPC error code. "OK" means everything looks good.
* *txs_as_hex* - string; Full transaction information as a hex string.
* *txs_as_json* - json string; (Optional - returned if set in inputs.) List of transaction info:
  * *version* - Transaction version
  * *unlock_time* - If not 0, this tells when a transaction output is spendable.
  * *vin* - List of inputs into transaction:
    * *key* - The public key of the previous output spent in this transaction.
      * *amount* - The amount of the input, in atomic units.
      * *key_offsets* - A list of integer offets to the input.
      * *k_image* - The key image for the given input
  * *vout* - List of outputs from transaction:
    * *amount* - Amount of transaction output, in atomic units.
    * *target* - Output destination information:
      * *key* - The stealth public key of the receiver. Whoever owns the private key associated with this key controls this transaction output.
  * *extra* - Usually called the "payment ID" but can be used to include any random 32 bytes.
  * *signatures* - List of ignatures used in ring signature to hide the true origin of the transaction.
Example 1: Return transaction information in binary format.

```
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18081/gettransactions -d '{"txs_hashes":["d6e48158472848e6687173a91ae6eebfa3e1d778e65252ee99d7515d63090408"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
