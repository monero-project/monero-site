`monero-wallet-cli` is the wallet software shipped in the Monero archives. It is a console program,
and manages an account. While a bitcoin wallet manages both an account and the blockchain,
Monero separates these: `monerod` handles the blockchain, and `monero-wallet-cli` handles the account.

This guide will show how to perform various operations with `monero-wallet-cli`. The guide assumes you are using the most recent version of Monero and have already created an account according to the other guides.

## Overview

You can have a list of the most important commands by running `help`:

```
Important commands:

"welcome" - Show welcome message.
"help all" - Show the list of all available commands.
"help <command>" - Show a command's documentation.
"apropos <keyword>" - Show commands related to a keyword.

"wallet_info" - Show wallet main address and other info.
"balance" - Show balance.
"address all" - Show all addresses.
"address new" - Create new subaddress.
"transfer <address> <amount>" - Send XMR to an address.
"show_transfers [in|out|pending|failed|pool]" - Show transactions.
"sweep_all <address>" - Send whole balance to another wallet.
"seed" - Show secret 25 words that can be used to recover this wallet.
"refresh" - Synchronize wallet with the Monero network.
"status" - Check current status of wallet.
"version" - Check software version.
"exit" - Exit wallet.

"donate <amount>" - Donate XMR to the development team.
```

## Checking your balance

Since the blockchain handling and the wallet are separate programs, many uses of `monero-wallet-cli`
need to work with the @daemon. This includes looking for incoming transactions to your address.
Once you are running both `monero-wallet-cli` and `monerod`, enter `balance`.

Output:

```
Currently selected account: [0] Primary account
Tag: (No tag assigned)
Balance: 7.499942880000, unlocked balance: 7.499942880000
```

In this example you're viewing the balance of your primary account (with index `[0]`). `Balance` is your total balance. The `unlocked balance` is the amount currently available to spend. Newly received transactions require 10 confirmations on the blockchain before being unlocked. 

## Sending monero

You will need the standard address you want to send to (a long string starting with '4' or a '8'). The  command structure is:

```
transfer ADDRESS AMOUNT
```

Replace `ADDRESS` with the address you want to send to and `AMOUNT` with how many monero you want to send.

## Receiving monero

If you have your own Monero address, you just need to give your address to someone.

You can find out your primary address with:

```
address
```

Since Monero is anonymous, you won't see the origin address the funds you receive came from. If you
want to know, for instance to credit a particular customer, you'll have to tell the sender to use
a payment ID, which is an arbitrary optional tag which gets attached to a transaction. It's not possible to use standalone payment addresses, but you can generate an address that already includes a random payment ID (integrated addresss) using `integrated_address`:

```
Random payment ID: <82d79055f3b27f56>
Matching integrated address: 4KHQkZ4MmVePC2yau6Mb8vhuGGy8LVdsZD8CFcQJvr4BSTfC5AQX3aXCn5RiDPjvsEHiJu1TC1ybR8pRTCbZM5bhTrAD3HDwWMtAn1K7nV
```

This will generate a random payment ID, and give you the address that includes your own account
and that payment ID. If you want to select a particular payment ID, you can do that too. Use:

```
integrated_address 82d79055f3b27f56
```

Payments made to an integrated address generated from your account will go to your account,
with that payment ID attached, so you can tell payments apart.

### Using subaddresses

It's suggested to use subaddresses (starting with `8`) instead of your main address (starting with `4`) to receive funds. Run:

```
address new
```

This will generate a subaddress, which you can share to receive payment on the account it's linked to. To view all generated addresses, run:

```
address list
```

## Proving to a third party you paid someone

If you pay a merchant, and the merchant claims to not have received the funds, you may need
to prove to a third party you did send the funds - or even to the merchant, if it is a honest
mistake. Monero is private, so you can't just point to your transaction in the blockchain,
as you can't tell who sent it, and who received it. However, by supplying the per-transaction
private key to a party, that party can tell whether that transaction sent monero to that
particular address. Note that storing these per-transaction keys is disabled by default, and
you will have to enable it before sending, if you think you may need it:

```
set store-tx-info 1
```

You can retrieve the tx key from an earlier transaction:

```
get_tx_key 1234567890123456789012345678901212345678901234567890123456789012
```

Pass in the transaction ID you want the key for. Remember that a payment might have been
split in more than one transaction, so you may need several keys. You can then send that key,
or these keys, to whoever you want to provide proof of your transaction, along with the
transaction id and the address you sent to. Note that this third party, if knowing your
own address, will be able to see how much change was returned to you as well.

If you are the third party (that is, someone wants to prove to you that they sent monero
to an address), then you can check this way:

```
check_tx_key TXID TXKEY ADDRESS
```

Replace `TXID`, `TXKEY` and `ADDRESS` with the transaction ID, per-transaction key, and destination
address which were supplied to you, respectively. `monero-wallet-cli` will check that transaction
and let you know how much monero this transaction paid to the given address.

## How to find a payment to you

If you received a payment using a particular payment ID, you can look it up:

```
payments PAYMENTID
```

You can give more than one payment ID too.

More generally, you can review incoming and outgoing payments:

```
show_transfers
```

You can give an optional height to list only recent transactions, and request
only incoming or outgoing transactions. For example,

```
show_transfers in 650000
```

will only show incoming transfers after block 650000. You can also give a height
range.

If you want to mine, you can do so from the wallet:

```
start_mining 2
```

This will start mining on the daemon usin two threads. Note that this is solo mining,
and may take a while before you find a block. To stop mining:

```
stop_mining
```
