msgid "This innovative POW is optimized for CPUs and it's based on execution of random code and other memory-heavy techniques. The goal is to discourage the use of specialized hardware (like ASICs) for @mining Monero. RandomX was created with the intent of keeping mining decentralized and to create a more egalitarian distribution of the @block rewards."
