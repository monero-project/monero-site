Monero contributors primarily communicate via IRC and Matrix channels. You
can join IRC/Libera and Matrix rooms using Matrix. An open source network
for secure, decentralized communication.

In order to access the Matrix protocol you will need to use a Matrix
client. In this tutorial we will use Element as a client. Element is a free,
open-source program that can be accessed via web, desktop, and mobile.

### Getting Element

Go to [element.io](https://element.io/get-started#download) to download the
latest version of the Element app on your computer. Alternatively you can
use the Element [web app](https://app.element.io). There are Android apps
available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/) or
[Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app). As well
as an app for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/vector/id1083446067). Once
you have accessed the client of your choice create an account on our host
server.

### Setting the custom host server

While matrix is a federated protocol and you could use any host server for
your account (including the default matrix.org server). We recommend
changing your server to the one hosted, maintained and [sponsored]({{
site.baseurl }}/community/sponsorships/) by the Monero Community to support
decentralization. If you do choose this option remember to set your custom
server when logging in on a new device.

When signing up choose to edit your host server and type in `monero.social`
as shown.

### Creating your account

You must provide an e-mail, username and password to setup an account. The
email field is used solely for anti-spam measures and recovering your
account if you lose your password.

Once you have entered in your credentials continue through the setup steps,
and log into your account. Now search for "Monero" rooms and join the
communities you like!

### Joining the Monero rooms

Now you are ready to join the Monero rooms, to find the list of rooms, check
out the [workgroups](/community/workgroups/) and
[hangouts](/community/hangouts/).
