home:
  heading2: A Reasonably Private Digital Currency
  monero_is_cash: Monero is cash for a connected world. It’s fast, private, and secure.
    With Monero, you are your own bank. You can spend safely, knowing that others
    cannot see your balances or track your activity.
  get_started: Get Started
  why_monero_is_different: Why Monero is different
  monero_is_secure: Monero is secure
  monero_is_secure_para: Monero is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is secure
    digital cash operated by a network of users. Transactions are confirmed by distributed
    consensus and then immutably recorded on the blockchain. Third-parties do not
    need to be trusted to keep your Monero safe.
  monero_is_private: Monero is private
  monero_is_private_para: Monero uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions,
    and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all
    transactions. Monero provides all the benefits of a decentralized cryptocurrency,
    without any of the typical privacy concessions.
  monero_is_untraceable: Monero is untraceable
  monero_is_untraceable_para: Sending and receiving addresses as well as transacted
    amounts are obfuscated by default. Transactions on the Monero blockchain cannot
    be linked to a particular user or real-world identity.
  monero_is_fungible: Monero is fungible
  monero_is_fungible_para1: Monero is
  monero_is_fungible_para2: fungible
  monero_is_fungible_para3: because it is private by default. Units of Monero cannot
    be blacklisted by vendors or exchanges due to their association in previous transactions.

monero-project:
  kovri: The Kovri project uses end-to-end encryption so that neither the sender nor
    receiver of a Monero transaction need to reveal their IP address to the other
    side or to third-party observers (the blockchain). This is done using the same
    technology that powers the dark net, i2p (Invisible Internet Protocol). The project
    is currently in heavy, active development and is not yet integrated with Monero.

accepting:
  title_gui: Instructions for the GUI
  gui1: "Accepting a payment with the GUI is very easy. Doesn't matter if you are\
    \ a merchant or an user, you will have two pages available: Receive and Merchants."
  gui2: The receive page (shown below) is explained in every detail
  guilinkguide: in the guide of the GUI.
  guiinstructions: >
    To receive XMR you only need to provide the payer with an @address where they
    can send funds to. Most of the time it's easier to just share a QR code and let
    the payer scan it, instead of copy-pasting the alphanumeric string.
    With the GUI every generated address come with its QR code. Make the person scan
    the QR code with the Monero @wallet on their phone and receive your XMR in minutes.
    Remember you can generate as many addresses (subaddresses) as you want. This is
    useful if you want to keep funds separated for any reason.
  guimerchant: Merchants will probably find more convenient to use the 'Merchant'
    page (screenshot below), which is explained in detail in the 'Merchant view' section
    of
  guilinkguide1: the guide linked above
  guimerchant1: >
    This is a POS-like page that merchant can easily use to set the amount of XMR
    to receive. If the 'Sale tracker' option is enabled,
    you will see the payments while they arrive in real time in your wallet, along
    with the number of confirmations.
  guisteps: 'These two pages give everybody the possibility to easily receive XMR
    following these steps:'
  guiol: Go to the 'Receive' page and create/select the address where you want to
    receive your coins.
  guiol1: Share the address composed by letters and numbers to the person you want
    to receive coins from. You probably prefer to use the more user friendly QR code.
  guiol2: If you want to specify the amount to receive, got to the 'Merchant' page
    (after you selected in the 'Receive' page the @account that will be used to receive
    XMR).
  guiol3: Insert the amount to receive, then share with the payer the payment URL
    or the QR code. If you want to track the payment in real time, tick the 'enable
    sales tracker' option.
  guiol4: Wait until the payment is arrived and has enough confirmations (The more
    confirmations, the safer the transaction is. You need at least 10 confirmations
    before you can spend the funds.).
  cliinstructions: Instructions for the CLI
  clicreatewallet: >
    When you create your wallet for the first time, an @address will be automatically
    shown to you. That's your primary address.
    If you want, you can simply use that address to receive payments. You should be
    concerned about who knows about this address (since one address in different locations
    can be associated),
    but you do not need to worry about blockchain observers watching transactions
    to this address like with Bitcoin. A friend can send transactions to the same
    address without reduced privacy.
  cliaccounts: >
    You can have much more control if you want to. Monero gives the possibility to
    create multiple accounts, each containing multiple subaddresses,
    useful if you want to control multiple accounts. For example, you may want to
    have an @account for receiving donations and another one for your daily use.
    That will allow you to easily monitor incoming funds to your 'donations' account,
    without mixing it with your primary account.
  clicreateaccount: 'To create an account, simply run this command:'
  clicreateaccount1: Now you have another account separated from your primary one.
    You can switch anytime between accounts.
  cliindex: >
    As you can see from the picture above, every account has an index number that
    you can use to switch from one account to the other using the command
    `account switch [index]`. For example, using the picture above as reference, if
    you would like to switch to the 'Donations' account to monitor it,
    you can do so by giving your CLI this command `account switch 1`. Now you are
    sitting on your 'Donations' account and you can start using it right away.
  cliindex1: >
    Every account can host a virtually infinite amount of subaddresses. These work
    exactly like a normal address and you can create as many
    as you want and use them to receive XMR to the account they are linked to. To
    create a new subaddress for an account, use the command:
  clinotes: >
    Note that the instructions below are just the minimal necessary to create and
    use accounts/subaddresses.
    The CLI offer more capillary ways to handle accounts and the wallet in general.
    Use the command 'help' to list all the available options.
  merchantstitle: Instructions for merchants
  merchantsreceive: If you are a business and you wish to programmatically receive
    @transactions or use advanced features like multisignature, it's suggested to
    consult the
  merchdevguides: developer guides
  merchantsreceive1: 'If you need support, the community will always be happy to help.
    Come chat on #monero, the chatroom is on Freenode, but also relayed on MatterMost
    and Matrix.'
  merchantsint: If you prefer to not directly deal with the wallets, you can use a
    third party payment system. Members of the monero community has created a set
    of integrations for various platform and languages. You can find more info on
  merchantsintlink: the GitHub organization
  merchantsthirdp: If you are looking for other third party integration system, there
    is a list of payment gateways on
  merchthirdlink: the merchant page
  merchantsthirdp1: Some of those offer nice features like the possibility to automatically
    convert part of your income in fiat money or to accept other cryptocurrencies
    along with Monero.

    specific aspect of the development. Some examples are: the localization workgroup
    (translations), the community workgroup, the GUI workgroup, the Outreach workgroup
    and so on. Workgroups are mostly independent and have their own structure. Contact
    the workgroup that interests you and ask how you can help. for a list of contacts

    images and spread them around. Are you a writer? Write about Monero. The only
    limit is your imagination. Find what you like to do and do it for Monero!
  acontribute4: 'The Outreach workgroup wrote a useful article to help newcomers:'
  q1: How does Monero have value?
  a1: Monero has value because people are willing to buy it. If no one is willing
    to buy Monero, then it will not have any value. Monero’s price increases if demand
    exceeds supply, and it decreases if supply exceeds demand.
  q2: How can I get Monero?
  a2: You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Alternatively, you
    can try mining Monero to get coins from the @block reward.
  q3: Why is the Mnemonic Seed important?
  a3: A @mnemonic-seed is a set of 25 words that can be used to restore your account
    anywhere. Keep these words safe and do not share them with someone else. You can
    use this seed to restore your account, even if your computer crashes.
  q4: How is Monero’s privacy different from other coins?
  a4: 'Monero uses three different privacy technologies: @ring-signatures, ring confidential
    transactions (@RingCT), and @stealth-addresses. These hide the sender, amount,
    and receiver in the @transaction, respectively. All transactions on the network
    are private by mandate; there is no way to accidentally send a transparent transaction.
    This feature is exclusive to Monero. You do not need to trust anyone else with
    your privacy.'
  q5: Why is my wallet taking so long to sync?
  a5: If you are running a full @node locally, you need to copy the entire @blockchain
    to your computer. This can take a long time, especially on an old hard drive or
    slow internet connection. If you are using a @remote-node, your computer still
    needs to request a copy of all the outputs, which can take several hours. Be patient,
    and if you would like to sacrifice some privacy for faster sync times, consider
    using a remote node or lightweight @wallet instead.
  q6: What is the difference between a lightweight and a normal wallet?
  a6: For a lightweight wallet, you give your view key to a node, who scans the blockchain
    and looks for incoming transactions to your account on your behalf. This node
    will know when you receive money, but it will not know how much you receive, who
    you received it from, or who you are sending money to. Depending on your wallet
    software, you may be able to use a node you control to avoid privacy leaks. For
    more privacy, use a normal wallet, which can be used with your own node.
  q7: How is Monero different from Bitcoin?
  a7: Monero is not based on Bitcoin. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Bitcoin
    is a completely transparent system, where people can see exactly how much money
    is being sent from one user to another. Monero hides this information to protect
    user privacy in all transactions. It also has a dynamic @block size and dynamic
    fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work (RandomX), and a @tail-emission, among several
    other changes.
  q8: Does Monero have a block size limit?
  a8: No, Monero does not have a hard @block size limit. Instead, the block size can
    increase or decrease over time based on demand. It is capped at a certain growth
    rate to prevent outrageous growth (@scalability).
  q11: What is fungibility, and why is it important?
  a11: '@Fungibility is a simple property of money such that there are no differences
    between two amounts of the same value. If two people exchanged a 10 and two 5’s,
    then no one would lose out. However, let’s suppose that everyone knows the 10
    was previously used in a ransomware attack. Is the other person still going to
    make the trade? Probably not, even if the person with the 10 has no connection
    with the ransomware. This is a problem, since the receiver of money needs to constantly
    check the money they are receiving to not end up with tainted coins. Monero is
    fungible, which means people do not need to go through this effort.'
  q12: If Monero is so private how do we know they're not being created out of thin
    air?
  a12-1: In Monero, every @transaction output is uniquely associated with a key image
    that can only be generated by the holder of that output. Key images that are used
    more than once are rejected by the miners as double-spends and cannot be added
    to a valid @block. When a new transaction is received, miners verify that the
    key image does not already exist for a previous transaction to ensure it's not
    a double-spend.
  a12-2: We can also know that transaction amounts are valid even though the value
    of the inputs that you are spending and the value of the outputs you are sending
    are encrypted (these are hidden to everyone except the recipient). Because the
    amounts are encrypted using @Pedersen-commitments what this means is that no observers
    can tell the amounts of the inputs and outputs, but they can do math on the Pedersen
    commitments to determine that no Monero was created out of thin air.
  a12-3: As long as the encrypted output amounts you create is equal to the sum of
    the inputs that are being spent (which include an output for the recipient and
    a change output back to yourself and the unencrypted transaction fee), then you
    have a legitimate transaction and know no Monero is being created out of thin
    air. Pedersen commitments mean that the sums can be verified as being equal, but
    the Monero value of each of the sums and the Monero value of the inputs and outputs
    individually are undeterminable.
  q13: Is Monero magic and protect my privacy no matter what I do?
  a13: Monero is not magic. If you use Monero but give your name and address to another
    party, the other party will not magically forget your name and address. If you
    give out your secret keys, others will know what you've done. If you get compromised,
    others will be able to keylog you. If you use a weak password, others will be
    able to brute force your keys file. If you backup your seed in the cloud, you'll
    be poorer soon.
  q14: Is Monero 100% anonymous?
  a14: There is no such thing as 100% anonymous. If nothing else, your anonymity set
    is the set of people using Monero. Some people don't use Monero. Monero may also
    have bugs. Even if not, ways may exist to infer some information through Monero's
    privacy layers, either now or later. Attacks only get better. If you wear a seatbelt,
    you can still die in a car crash. Use common sense, prudence and defense in depth.
  q15: Is Monero a mixer or mixing service?
  a15: No. Monero uses a completely non-interactive, non-custodial, and automatic
    process to create private transactions. By contrast for mixing services, users
    opt-in to participate.
  qwallet: What wallet should I use?
  awallet: There are multiple wallets available for a vast number of platforms. On
    this website you'll find the wallets released by the Core Team (GUI and CLI) and
    a list of widely trusted and open source third party wallets for desktop and mobile.
  qnofunds: I can't see my funds. Did I just lose all my Monero?
  anofunds: You probably didn't. It's very hard to simply 'lose' your coins, since
    they are technically nowhere. Your coins 'live' on the blockchain and are linked
    to your account through a system of public and private keys secured by cryptography.
    That's why if you don't see your funds, it's probably because of a technical issue.
    Take a look at the 'Resources & Help' section at the top of this page for a list
    of useful resources that will help you identify and fix your problem.
  qnodetor: How can I connect my node via Tor?
  anodetor: Support for Tor is still in its infancies, but it's already possible to
    natively send transactions through the network and to run a Monero daemon on the
    Tor network. Better Tor and I2P integrations are in progress.
  qfullpruned: How do I decide if I should run a full node or a pruned node?
  afullpruned: A full @node requires a considerable amount of storage and could take
    a long time to download and verify the entire blockchain, especially on older
    hardware. If you have limited storage, a pruned node is recommended. It only stores
    1/8th of unnecessary blockchain data while keeping the full transaction history.
    If plenty of storages is available, a full node is recommended but a pruned node
    still greatly contributes to the network and improves your privacy.
  qblockspace: Why does the blockchain need so much space?
  ablockspace: When you download the @blockchain, you are downloading the entire history
    of the @transactions that happened in the Monero network since it was created.
    The transactions and the related data are heavy and the entire history must be
    kept by every node to ensure it's the same for everybody. @pruning a blockchain
    allows to run a node which keeps only 1/8 of not strictly necessary blockchain
    data. This results in a blockchain 2/3 smaller than a full one. Convenient for
    people with limited disk space. Check out the Moneropedia entries @node and @remote-node
    for more details.
  qavoidbc: Can I avoid downloading the entire blockchain?
  aavoidbc: Yes. You don't need to download the @blockchain to transact on the network.
    You can connect to a @remote-node, which stores the blockchain for you. All the
    most common @wallets (including GUI and CLI) allow to use remote nodes to transact
    on the network. There are multiple ways to take advantage of this functionality.
    For example GUI and CLI offer a 'bootstrap node' feature, which allow people to
    download their own blockchain while using a remote node to immediately use the
    network. Ways to improve the usability of the Monero network are constantly being
    explored.
  qscanned: Why my wallet needs to be scanned everytime I open it?
  ascanned: Because new @transactions have been recorded on the @blockchain from the
    last time you opened your wallet, which needs to scan all of them to make sure
    non of those transaction is yours. This process is not necessary in a mymonero-style
    (openmonero) wallet, a central server (which could be managed by you) does this
    work for you.
  qdangernode: Is it dangerous to run a personal node?
  adangernode: Running a personal @node is the safest way to interact with the Monero
    network, because you are in full control and you don't need to rely on third parties.
    From a general point of view running a node is not dangerous, but keep in mind
    that your ISP can see you are running a Monero node.
  qdangerrnode: Is it dangerous to use a remote node? What's the data a node operator
    can get from me?
  adangerrnode: "It's always advisable, especially for privacy-conscious users, to\
    \ use a personal node when transacting on the network to achieve the highest rate\
    \ of privacy. Some people for convenience prefer to use @remote-node which are\
    \ not under their control (public nodes). The convenience of not having to deal\
    \ with a personal copy of the @blockchain comes at a cost: lessened privacy. A\
    \ remote node operator is able to see from what IP address a transaction comes\
    \ from (even if cannot see the recipient nor the amount) and in some extreme cases,\
    \ can make attacks able to reduce your privacy. Some dangers can be mitigated\
    \ by using remote nodes on the Tor or I2P networks or using a VPN."

what-is-monero:
  need-to-know: What you need to know
  leading: Monero is the leading cryptocurrency with a focus on private and censorship-resistant
    transactions.
  leading_para1: Most existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have
    transparent blockchains, meaning that transactions are openly verifiable and traceable
    by anyone in the world. Furthermore, sending and receiving addresses for these
    transactions may potentially be linkable to a person's real-world identity.
  leading_para2: Monero uses cryptography to shield sending and receiving addresses,
    as well as transacted amounts.
  confidential: Monero transactions are confidential and untraceable.
  confidential_para1: Every Monero transaction, by default, obfuscates sending and
    receiving addresses as well as transacted amounts. This always-on privacy means
    that every Monero user's activity enhances the privacy of all other users, unlike
    selectively transparent cryptocurrencies (e.g. Zcash).
  confidential_para2: Monero is fungible. By virtue of obfuscation, Monero cannot
    become tainted through participation in previous transactions. This means Monero
    will always be accepted without the risk of censorship.
  confidential_para3: The Kovri Project,
  confidential_para4: currently in development
  confidential_para5: ", will route and encrypt transactions via I2P Invisible Internet\
    \ Project nodes. This will obfuscate a transactor's IP address and provide further\
    \ protection against network monitoring."
  grassroots: Monero is a grassroots community attracting the world's best cryptocurrency
    researchers and engineering talent.
  grassroots_para1: Over
  grassroots_para2: 500 developers
  grassroots_para3: have contributed to the Monero project, including 30 core developers.
    Forums and chat channels are welcoming and active.
  grassroots_para4: Monero's Research Lab, Core Development Team and Community Developers
    are constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy
    and security.
  grassroots_para5: Monero is not a corporation. It is developed by cryptography and
    distributed systems experts from all over the world that donate their time or
    are funded by community donations. This means that Monero can't be shut down by
    any one country and is not constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction.
  electronic: Monero is electronic cash that allows fast, inexpensive payments to
    and from anywhere in the world.
  electronic_para1: There are no multi-day holding periods and no risk of fraudulent
    chargebacks. It is safe from ‘capital controls’ - these are measures that restrict
    the flow of traditional currencies, sometimes to an extreme degree, in countries
    experiencing economic instability.

about:
  history: A Brief History
  history_para1: Monero was launched in April 2014. It was a fair, pre-announced launch
    of the CryptoNote reference code. There was no premine or instamine, and no portion
    of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread
  history_para2: here.
  history_para3: The founder, thankful_for_today, proposed some controversial changes
    that the community disagreed with. A fallout ensued, and the Monero Core Team
    forked the project with the community following this new Core Team. This Core
    Team has provided oversight since.
  history_para4: Monero has made several large improvements since launch. The blockchain
    was migrated to a different database structure to provide greater efficiency and
    flexibility, minimum ring signature sizes were set so that all transactions were
    private by mandate, and RingCT was implemented to hide the transaction amounts.
    Nearly all improvements have provided improvements to security or privacy, or
    they have facilitated use. Monero continues to develop with goals of privacy and
    security first, ease of use and efficiency second.
  values: Our Values
  values_para: Monero is more than just a technology. It’s also what the technology
    stands for. Some of the important guiding philosophies are listed below.
  security: Security
  security_para: Users must be able to trust Monero with their transactions, without
    risk of error or attack. Monero gives the full block reward to the miners, who
    are the most critical members of the network who provide this security. Transactions
    are cryptographically secure using the latest and most resilient encryption tools
    available.
  privacy: Privacy
  privacy_para: Monero takes privacy seriously. Monero needs to be able to protect
    users in a court of law and, in extreme cases, from the death penalty. This level
    of privacy must be completely accessible to all users, whether they are technologically
    competent or have no idea how Monero works. A user needs to confidently trust
    Monero in a way that this person does not feel pressured into changing their spending
    habits for risk of others finding out.
  decentralization: Decentralization
  decentralization_para: Monero is committed to providing the maximum amount of decentralization.
    With Monero, you do not have to trust anyone else on the network, and it is not
    run by any large group. An accessible “Proof of Work” algorithm makes it easy
    to mine Monero on normal computers, which makes it more difficult for someone
    to purchase a large amount of mining power. Nodes connect to each other with I2P
    to lower the risks of revealing sensitive transaction information and censorship
    (tba). Development decisions are extremely clear and open to public discussion.
    Developer meeting logs are published online in their entirety and visible by all.

research-lab:
  intro: Monero is not only committed to making a fungible currency, but also to continued
    research into the realm of financial privacy as it involves cryptocurrencies.
    Below you'll find the work of our very own Monero Research Lab, with more papers
    to come.
  mrl_papers: Monero Research Lab Papers (English)
  abstract: Abstract
  introduction: Introduction
  read-paper: Read Paper
  summary: Summary
  mrlhtp: Understanding ge_fromfe_frombytes_vartime
  mrlhtp_summary: Monero uses a unique hash function that transforms scalars into
    elliptic curve points. It is useful for creating key images, in particular. This
    document, authored by Shen Noether, translates its code implementation (the ge_fromfe_frombytes_vartime()
    function) into mathematical expressions.
  mrl1: A Note on Chain Reactions in Traceability in CryptoNote 2.0
  mrl1_abstract: This research bulletin describes a plausible attack on a ring-signature
    based anonymity system. We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote
    2.0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012. It has been previously
    demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one-time key pair can be dependent
    upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that ring signature.
    This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability between ring
    signatures, causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole network
    if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sufficient percentage
    of the network. The signatures are still one-time, however, and any such attack
    will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users. However, such an attack
    could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against blockchain
    analysis. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only
    the results of internal investigation.
  mrl2: Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing
    the CryptoNote Protocol
  mrl2_abstract: On 4 September 2014, an unusual and novel attack was executed against
    the Monero cryptocurrency network. This attack partitioned the network into two
    distinct subsets which refused to accept the legitimacy of the other subset. This
    had myriad effects, not all of which are yet known. The attacker had a short window
    of time during which a sort of counterfeiting could occur, for example. This research
    bulletin describes deficiencies in the CryptoNote reference code allowing for
    this attack, describes the solution initially put forth by Rafal Freeman from
    Tigusoft.pl and subsequently by the CryptoNote team, describes the current fix
    in the Monero code base, and elaborates upon exactly what the offending block
    did to the network. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and
    reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl3: Monero is Not That Mysterious
  mrl3_abstract: Recently, there have been some vague fears about the CryptoNote source
    code and protocol floating around the internet based on the fact that it is a
    more complicated protocol than, for instance, Bitcoin. The purpose of this note
    is to try and clear up some misconceptions, and hopefully remove some of the mystery
    surrounding Monero Ring Signatures. I will start by comparing the mathematics
    involved in CryptoNote ring signatures (as described in [CN]) to the mathematics
    in [FS], on which CryptoNote is based. After this, I will compare the mathematics
    of the ring signature to what is actually in the CryptoNote codebase.
  mrl4: Improving Obfuscation in the CryptoNote Protocol
  mrl4_abstract: We identify several blockchain analysis attacks available to degrade
    the untraceability of the CryptoNote 2.0 protocol. We analyze possible solutions,
    discuss the relative merits and drawbacks to those solutions, and recommend improvements
    to the Monero protocol that will hopefully provide long-term resistance of the
    cryptocurrency against blockchain analysis. Our recommended improvements to Monero
    include a protocol-level network-wide minimum mix-in policy of n = 2 foreign outputs
    per ring signature, a protocol-level increase of this value to n = 4 after two
    years, and a wallet-level default value of n = 4 in the interim. We also recommend
    a torrent-style method of sending Monero output. We also discuss a non-uniform,
    age-dependent mix-in selection method to mitigate the other forms of blockchain
    analysis identified herein, but we make no formal recommendations on implementation
    for a variety of reasons. The ramifications following these improvements are also
    discussed in some detail. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review,
    and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl5: Ring Signature Confidential Transactions
  mrl5_abstract: This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in
    the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin,
    Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof of work “mining”
    process. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring
    signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions.
    Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction
    has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell.
    In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous
    Anonymous Group signature is described which allows for hidden amounts, origins
    and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless
    coin generation. Some extensions of the protocol are provided, such as Aggregate
    Schnorr Range Proofs, and Ring Multisignature. The author would like to note that
    early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the bitcoin
    research irc channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available in [14] showing that
    this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An
    eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.
  mrl6: An Efficient Implementation of Monero Subaddresses
  mrl6_abstract: Users of the Monero cryptocurrency who wish to reuse wallet addresses
    in an unlinkable way must maintain separate wallets, which necessitates scanning
    incoming transactions for each one. We document a new address scheme that allows
    a user to maintain a single master wallet address and generate an arbitary number
    of unlinkable subaddresses. Each transaction needs to be scanned only once to
    determine if it is destinated for any of the user’s subaddresses. The scheme additionally
    supports multiple outputs to other subaddresses, and is as efficient as traditional
    wallet transactions.
  mrl7: Sets of Spent Outputs
  mrl7_abstract: This technical note generalizes the concept of spend outputs using
    basic set theory. The definition captures a variety of earlier work on identifying
    such outputs. We quantify the effects of this analysis on the Monero blockchain
    and give a brief overview of mitigations.
  mrl8: Dual Linkable Ring Signatures
  mrl8_abstract: This bulletin describes a modification to Monero's linkable ring
    signature scheme that permits dual-key outputs as ring members. Key images are
    tied to both output one-time public keys in a dual, preventing both keys in that
    transaction from being spent separately. This method has applications to non-interactive
    refund transactions. We discuss the security implications of the scheme.
  mrl9: Thring Signatures and their Applications to Spender-Ambiguous Digital Currencies
  mrl9_abstract: We present threshold ring multi-signatures (thring signatures) for
    collaborative computation of ring signatures, present a game of existential forgery
    for thring signatures, and discuss uses of thring signatures in digital currencies
    that include spender-ambiguous cross-chain atomic swaps for confidential amounts
    without a trusted setup. We present an implementation of thring signatures that
    we call linkable spontaneous threshold anonymous group signatures, and prove the
    implementation existentially unforgeable.
  mrl10: Discrete Logarithm Equality Across Groups
  mrl10_abstract: This technical note describes an algorithm used to prove knowledge
    of the same discrete logarithm across different groups. The scheme expresses the
    common value as a scalar representation of bits, and uses a set of ring signatures
    to prove each bit is a valid value that is the same (up to an equivalence) across
    both scalar groups.
  iacr2019654: Concise Linkable Ring Signatures and Forgery Against Adversarial Keys
  iacr2019654_abstract: We demonstrate that a version of non-slanderability is a natural
    definition of unforgeability for linkable ring signatures. We present a linkable
    ring signature construction with concise signatures and multi-dimensional keys
    that is linkably anonymous if a variation of the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem
    with random oracles is hard, linkable if key aggregation is a one-way function,
    and non-slanderable if a one-more variation of the discrete logarithm problem
    is hard. We remark on some applications in signer-ambiguous confidential transaction
    models without trusted setup.
  iacr2020018: 'Triptych: logarithmic-sized linkable ring signatures with applications'
  iacr2020018_abstract: Ring signatures are a common construction used to provide
    signer ambiguity among a non-interactive set of public keys specified at the time
    of signing. Unlike early approaches where signature size is linear in the size
    of the signer anonymity set, current optimal solutions either require centralized
    trusted setups or produce signatures logarithmic in size. However, few also provide
    linkability, a property used to determine whether the signer of a message has
    signed any previous message, possibly with restrictions on the anonymity set choice.
    Here we introduce Triptych, a family of linkable ring signatures without trusted
    setup that is based on generalizations of zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of
    commitment openings to zero. We demonstrate applications of Triptych in signer-ambiguous
    transaction protocols by extending the construction to openings of parallel commitments
    in independent anonymity sets. Signatures are logarithmic in the anonymity set
    size and, while verification complexity is linear, collections of proofs can be
    efficiently verified in batches. We show that for anonymity set sizes practical
    for use in distributed protocols, Triptych offers competitive performance with
    a straightforward construction.
  iacr2020312: 'Arcturus: efficient proofs for confidential transactions'
  iacr2020312_abstract: Confidential transactions are used in distributed digital
    assets to demonstrate the balance of values hidden in commitments, while retaining
    signer ambiguity. Previous work describes a signer-ambiguous proof of knowledge
    of the opening of commitments to zero at the same index across multiple public
    commitment sets and the evaluation of a verifiable random function used as a linking
    tag, and uses this to build a linkable ring signature called Triptych that can
    be used as a building block for a confidential transaction model. In this work,
    we extend Triptych to build Arcturus, a proving system that proves knowledge of
    openings of multiple commitments to zero within a single set, correct construction
    of a verifiable random function evaluated at each opening, and value balance across
    a separate list of commitments within a single proof. While soundness depends
    on a novel dual discrete-logarithm hardness assumption, we use data from the Monero
    blockchain to show that Arcturus can be used in a confidential transaction model
    to provide faster total batch verification time than other state-of-the-art constructions
    without a trusted setup.

  cryptonote-whitepaper: Cryptonote Whitepaper
  cryptonote-whitepaper_para: This is the original cryptonote paper written by the
    cryptonote team. Reading it will give an understanding about how the cryptonote
    algorithm works in general.
  annotated: Annotated Whitepaper
  annotated_para: The Monero Research Lab released an annotated version of the cryptonote
    whitepaper. This is sort of like an informal review of the claims that are made
    line-by-line of the whitepaper. It also explains some of the harder concepts in
    relatively easy to understand terms.
  brandon: Brandon Goodell's Whitepaper Review
  brandon_para: This paper is a formal review of the original cryptonote paper by
    MRL researcher Brandon Goodell. He takes an in-depth look at the claims and mathematics
    presented in the cryptonote paper.

  title: Technical Info
  intro: Here are listed some basic technical info about Monero. For more in-depth
    details, consult
  intro_link: the library
  intro1: or get in touch with the community
  pow_title: Proof of Work
  pow: Monero uses RandomX, an ASIC-resistant and CPU-friendly POW algorithm created
    by Monero community members, designed to make the use of mining-specific hardware
    unfeasible. Monero previously used CryptoNight and variations of this algorithm

  block_emission_title: Emission curve
  block_emission_pre: 'To make sure there will always be an incentive to mine Monero
    and keep it safe, the emission is infinite. There are two main emissions:'
  block_emission_main: 'first, main curve: ~18.132 million coins by the end of May
    2022'
  block_emission_tail: 'then, tail curve: 0.6 XMR per 2-minute block, kicks in once
    main emission is done, translates to <1% inflation decreasing over time'
  blocks_title: Blocks
  blocks: A new @block is created every ~2 minutes. There is no maximum block size,
    but instead a block reward penality and a dynamic block size, to ensure a dynamic
    @scalability

        A comprehensive conceptual (and technical) explanation of Monero.<br>
        We endeavor to teach anyone who knows basic algebra and simple computer science
        concepts like the ‘bit representation’ of a number not only how Monero works
        at a deep and comprehensive level, but also how useful and beautiful cryptography
        can be.
