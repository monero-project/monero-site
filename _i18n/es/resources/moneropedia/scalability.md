### The Basics

The size of Monero @blocks (which contain @transactions) is flexible and can
accommodate many transactions as demand changes. Formulas determine how the
reward miners receive interacts with the number of transactions they choose
to include in blocks. The @blockchain can therefore scale to meet changes in
transaction volume.

Scaling may also refer to the ability to conduct certain types of
intermediate transactions safely without interacting with a
blockchain. Monero does not currently support native off-chain solutions
like atomic swaps, since its privacy features do not permit the use of
required functionality like non-interactive refund transactions or complex
scripting. However, academic and industry research is ongoing and promising
in this area.
