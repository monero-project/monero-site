### Prove payments

When you send money to a party who then disputes the payment was made, you
need to be able to prove the payment was made.

With Bitcoin, this is typically done by looking up the transaction ID, where
the origin and destination addresses are shown, along with the amount
transacted.

Monero, however, is private: that information is not available publicly on
the blockchain. The steps are therefore a bit more involved.

To prove to Charlie that she made a payment to Bob, Alice must supply
Charlie three pieces of information:

- the transaction ID, as is done in Bitcoin
- Bob's address, as is done with Bitcoin
- the transaction's key, which is new with Monero and other CryptoNote
  currencies

When Alice made the transaction, a one time key was automatically generated
just for this transaction.

#### CLI

Alice can query it thus in monero-wallet-cli (new name for the old
simplewallet):

> get_tx_key TXID

Alice would plug in her actual transaction ID instead of this TXID
placeholder. All being well, the one time transaction key will be displayed.

Note that this will only work if monero-wallet-cli is set to save
transaction keys. To double check:

> set

If it's set to 0, set it to 1:

> set store-tx-info 1

#### GUI

Alice can open her monero-wallet-gui and go to the history page to see her
transaction detail:

![History](/img/resources/user-guides/en/prove-payment/history.avif)

Here, she can copy the transaction ID and Bob's address by clicking on each
of them.  Then she can click on `P` to get a payment proof (transaction
key):

---

Alice can now send Charlie the transaction key along with transaction ID and
Bob's address.

Note: if several transactions were made, this needs repeating for each such
transaction.

### Check payments

Charlie now received those three pieces of information, and wants to check
Alice is telling the truth: on an up to date blockchain,

#### CLI

Charlie types in monero-wallet-cli:

> check_tx_key TXID TXKEY ADDRESS

The information supplied by Alice plugs neatly instead of the
placeholders. monero-wallet-cli will use the transaction key to decode the
transaction, and display how much this particular transaction sent to this
address.

Obviously, Charlie will want to double check with Bob the address is really
his - same as with Bitcoin.

#### GUI

Charlie will open his monero-wallet-gui and go to the Advanced > Prove/Check page to fill the Check section with the informations provided by Alice:

![Check
payment-1](/img/resources/user-guides/en/prove-payment/check-payment-1.avif)
![Check
payment-2](/img/resources/user-guides/en/prove-payment/check-payment-2.avif)

Then clicking on Check will tell Charlie how much this particular
transaction sent to this address, and how much confirmation the transaction
had:
