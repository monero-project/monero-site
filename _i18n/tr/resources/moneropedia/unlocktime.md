### The Basics

A special transaction where the recipient can only spend the funds after a future date, as set by the sender.

Unlock time allows you to send a transaction to someone, such that they can not spend it until after a certain number of blocks, or until a certain time.

Note that this works differently than Bitcoin's [nLockTime](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/NLockTime), in which the transaction is not valid until the given time.
