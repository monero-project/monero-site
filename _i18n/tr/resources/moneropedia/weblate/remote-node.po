There are 2 main ways to connect to an open node: Simply get somebody to share with you their node, by asking them to \"open it\" and provide you with IP address and port, or use a public one."

The aggregator will provide to the person who want to use a remote node a simple URL. This URL connects to one of the nodes in the list and will need to be inserted in the Monero wallet (GUI or CLI). The wallet will then contact one of the nodes provided by the URL and will allow the end user to immediately receive and send transactions. One of the most famous node aggregators is [MoneroWorld](https://moneroworld.com/#nodes)."

msgid "- **Native public nodes**. This is one of the new coolest features the Monero devs came up with to improve the user experience and to make easier to connect to the network. The @daemon allows to make a node public by simply adding the flag `--public-node`. Doing so, it will be advertised on the P2P network and people will be able to connect to it (or to another public node advertising itself in the same way) using the related option in the GUI and CLI wallets."
