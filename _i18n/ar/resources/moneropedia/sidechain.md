### The Basics

A sidechain (also known as an auxillary chain) is a @blockchain that is
@merge-mined with Monero or other cryptocurrencies. In most cases the
sidechain will have a lower difficulty than the primary blockchain.

A sidechain that allows you to transfer assets between different blockchains
is called a "pegged blockchain". It works by setting the value of one asset
equal to the value of another asset on an alternate blockchain, otherwise
known as pegging.

Currently there are no pegged sidechains that exist for Monero.
