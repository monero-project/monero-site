msgid "Every Monero address has a private viewkey which can be shared.  By sharing a viewkey, a person is allowing access to view every incoming transaction for that address.  However, outgoing transactions cannot be reliably viewed as of June 2017. Therefore, the balance of a Monero address as shown via a viewkey should not be relied upon."
