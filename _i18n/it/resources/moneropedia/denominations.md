### The Basics

A denomination is a proper description of a currency amount, oftentimes a sub-unit of the currency (for example, traditionally a cent is 1/100th of a a unit of currency). Monero denomination names add SI prefixes after dropping the initial "mo" for ease of use. The smallest unit of Monero is 1 piconero (0.000000000001 XMR).

### In-depth Information

Support for input using SI prefixes was [added to the Monero codebase](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/1826) on March 3, 2017 by [Moneromooo](https://github.com/moneromooo-monero). The smallest unit of monero (10^-12 XMR) was originally called a tacoshi in honor of user [Tacotime](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=19270), an early Monero contributor and was later renamed for ease of use and consistancy.
