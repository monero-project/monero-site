RandomX is a Proof Of Work algorithm developed by Monero contributors and
adopted by Monero from release 0.15.

This innovative POW is optimized for CPUs and it's based on execution of
random code and other memory-heavy techniques. The goal is to discourage the
use of specialized hardware (like ASICs) for @mining Monero. RandomX was
created with the intent of keeping mining decentralized and to create a more
egalitarian distribution of the @block rewards.

RandomX specifications and development can be found [on the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX), while [an article dedicated
to RandomX](https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/RandomX.html) made by the
Outreach workgroup contains more information about the history of RandomX
and its relation with Monero.
