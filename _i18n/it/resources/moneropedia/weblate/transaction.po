msgid "The parameters of a transaction contain one or more recipient addresses with corresponding amounts of funds and a @ring-size parameter that specifies the number outputs bound to the transaction. The more outputs that are used, a higher degree of obfuscation is possible, but that comes with a cost. Since a transaction gets larger with more outputs, the transaction fee will be higher."
