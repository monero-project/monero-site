# Importing the Blockchain to Monero GUI wallet (Windows)

### Step 1

Download the Current bootstrap from https://downloads.getmonero.org/blockchain.raw; you can skip this step if you are importing the Blockchain from another source.

### Step 2

Find the path of your Monero wallet (the folder where you extracted your wallet). For example mine is:

`D:\monero-gui-0.10.3.1`

Your path may be different depending on where you decided to download your wallet and what version of the Monero wallet you have.

### Step 3

Find the path of your downloaded Blockchain for example mine was: 

`C:\Users\KeeJef\Downloads\blockchain.raw`

Yours might be different depending on where you downloaded the Blockchain to.

### Step 4

Open a Command Prompt window. You can do this by pressing the Windows key + R, and then typing in the popup box `CMD`

### Step 5

Now you need to navigate using the CMD window to the path of your Monero wallet. You can do this by typing:

`cd C:\YOUR\MONERO\WALLET\FILE\PATH\HERE` 

It should look something like:

`cd D:\monero-gui-0.10.3.1`

If your Monero wallet is on another drive you can use `DriveLetter:` for example if your Monero wallet was on your D drive then before using the cd command you would do `D:`

### Step 6

Now type in your command prompt window:

`monero-blockchain-import --verify 1 --input-file C:\YOUR\BLOCKCHAIN\FILE\PATH\HERE`

For example I would type :

`monero-blockchain-import --verify 1 --input-file C:\Users\KeeJef\Downloads\blockchain.raw`

If you downloaded the Blockchain from a trusted, reputable source you may set `verify 0` this will reduce the amount of time to sync the Blockchain.  

### Step 7

After the the Blockchain has finished syncing up you can open your Monero wallet normally. Your downloaded blockchain.raw can be deleted.
