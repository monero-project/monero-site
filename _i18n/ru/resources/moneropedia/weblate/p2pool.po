msgid "Monero P2Pool is a peer-to-peer Monero @mining pool developed by SChernykh (also known as sech1). P2Pool was a concept first developed for the Bitcoin blockchain but was never fully realized due to certain limitations, mainly because it had a problem with orphaned @blocks which is solved in Monero P2Pool with uncle blocks."

msgid "Unlike a traditional mining pool, P2Pool allows it's users to fully control their own @node and what it mines. P2Pool has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to @merge-mine with Monero. It is designed so that all blocks found by the pool pay out to the miners immediately which means that funds are never in custody of a single party."

Each miner submits block templates that include a payout for all of the miners that currently have shares in the PPLNS window.
