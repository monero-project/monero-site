"Most people don't need this. To use Monero, just start the software and it "
"will synchronize itself with the peer-to-peer network. Normally, this is "
"much faster than downloading and importing the blockchain as detailed in "
"this guide. This is because you'll be downloading from many peers instead of "
"just a single server, and the Monero @daemon will verify each block as it's "
"received, instead of verifying separately after downloading."

"**Never** use the dangerous unverified import option, it is strictly for "

"the Internet, including the official site. It is only safe to use if a) you "

"absolutely sure it was already fully and properly verified before "
