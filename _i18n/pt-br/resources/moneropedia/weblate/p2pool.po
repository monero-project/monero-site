"Monero P2Pool is a peer-to-peer Monero @mining pool developed by SChernykh "
"(also known as sech1). P2Pool was a concept was first developed for the "
"Bitcoin blockchain but was never fully realized due to certain limitations, "
"mainly because it had a problem with orphaned @blocks which is solved in "
"Monero P2Pool with uncle blocks."

"Unlike a traditional mining pool, P2Pool allows it's users to fully control "
"their own @node and what it mines. P2Pool has no central server that can be "
"shutdown/blocked because it uses a separate blockchain to @merge-mine with "
"Monero. It is designed so that all blocks found by the pool pay out to the "
"miners immediately which means that funds are never in custody of a single "
"party."

"To accomplish this P2Pool uses PPLNS payout scheme which rewards miners only "
"once the block has been found by the pool; miners with a share in the PPLNS "
"window are rewarded directly via the @coinbase-transaction reward for the "

"Monero P2Pool is written from scratch in C++. It uses the high-performance "

"The number of blocks was chosen so that the minimum payout would be "

"could be transferred with minimal fees). Each individual miner payout takes "
