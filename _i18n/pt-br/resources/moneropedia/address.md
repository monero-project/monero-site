### The Basics

When you send Monero to someone you only need one piece of information, and
that is their Monero address. A *raw* Monero address is a set of 95
characters starting with a '4' or an '8'. The Monero donation address, for
instance, is
888tNkZrPN6JsEgekjMnABU4TBzc2Dt29EPAvkRxbANsAnjyPbb3iQ1YBRk1UXcdRsiKc9dhwMVgN5S9cQUiyoogDavup3H.

Because those addresses are long and complex, you will often encounter an
@OpenAlias address instead. For example, Monero donations can be sent to
donate@getmonero.org or donate.getmonero.org.

If you would like to get an @OpenAlias address of your own then there is
some information on the [OpenAlias page](https://openalias.org/).

### Integrated address

An integrated address is an address combined with an encrypted 64-bit
@payment-ID. A raw integrated address is 106 characters long.

### In-depth Information

The address is actually the concatenation, in Base58 format, of the *public*
@spend-key and the *public* @view-key, prefixed with the network byte (the
number 18 for Monero) and suffixed with the first four bytes of the
Keccac-256 hash of the whole string (used as a checksum).
