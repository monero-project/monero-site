### The Basics

A sidechain (also known as an auxillary chain) is a @blockchain that is @merge-mined with Monero or other cryptocurrency. In most cases the sidechain will have a lower difficulty than the primary blockchain.

A pegged sidechain is a sidechain that allows you to transfer assets between different blockchains by pegging the value of one asset to another on an alternate blockchain. Currently there are no pegged sidechains that exist for Monero.
