### The Basics
RingCT, short for Ring Confidential Transactions, is how transaction amounts are hidden in Monero.

Ring CT was implemented in block #1220516 in January 2017.  After September 2017, this feature became mandatory for all transactions on the network.

RingCT introduces an improved version of @ring-signatures called "A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature", which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation.
