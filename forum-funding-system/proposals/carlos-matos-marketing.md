Hello everyone!

Now that my other project went viral, I'm trying to help out the Monero project
with my marketing and presentation skills.

Planned roadmap:

1. 10 XMR:
   I'll organize a Monero event and give a speech. Convince yourself of my previous work:

2. 10 XMR:
   I will continue representing Monero for the rest of my life.

I'm very talented, just ask my wife! Waaat? Das a skam? Hmm hmm nonono!
